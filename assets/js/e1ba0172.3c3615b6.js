The block selection involves two aspects: a) the node ranges approved blocks by nodes priority for the current attempt, so in each attempt the list is reordered, and b) the main validator node randomly selects a block for voting from this list. Each validator node processes the above-mentioned message and selects a block to vote for. A validator does not have to vote for the proposed block and is free to select another one. So the proposed block is more of a tip to provide an aim and to accelerate voting. Voting implies two things: a) signing block to mark it is voted by a particular validator node, and b) broadcasting this information in a ",(0,n.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"validatorSession.message.vote")," message to the rest of validators.

Chances are that votes are received after the attempt end. In this case the late votes are processed simultaneously with the new attempt. Generally, votes for each finished attempt may be accepted past deadline; constituting no logical error, it allows finishing the round faster. And, if any of previous attempts ends up getting 2/3 of total weights or more even past its deadline, it still yields a new pre-commit candidate.
