Then, even if the price of the memcoin goes to zero, the validators will still be required to store the information about your purchase forever. That is, you pay for the record once, but it will be stored forever. And here comes the interesting economics - blockchains are forced to limit the rate of recording transactions artificially so that the size of the blockchain state does not grow faster than data storage becomes cheaper. As a result, users are forced to compete with each other for the right to record data on the blockchain via an auction, and subsequently, transaction fees are increasing all the time."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Everscale, as a leading blockchain developer, never looks for easy and uncostly ways to solve blockchain issues.
