They communicate via sending datagrams to each other using only these 256-bit network addresses to identify both the sender and the receiver. In particular, one does not need to worry about IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, UDP port numbers, and the like. They are hidden by the Abstract Network Layer.Each datagram is signed and encrypted by the sender. Only the recipient has the possibility to decrypt the message and verify its integrity via signatures.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"arch/networking/dht":{"id":"arch/networking/dht","title":"DHT - Distributed Hash Table","description":"In fact, it is a distributed key-value database, where each network participant can save something.
