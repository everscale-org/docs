From the business plan of Pavel Durov, it follows that Telegram as a messenger is the first phase of a more global project, and was created mainly to form a huge customer base. As TON develops, the messenger itself will become just one of its applications, so in 2021 it is planned to rebrand Telegram Open Network into The Open Network, and the Telegram brand will remain with the messenger. The real goal of the project is the Telegram Open Network platform, which offers Gram cryptocurrency with fast transaction speeds, as well as various services from Proxy for bypassing censorship to bots and file storage that can be paid for with Gram cryptocurrency.
