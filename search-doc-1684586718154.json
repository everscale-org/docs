One of them (-1), a so-called masterchain, is needed for service contracts and validator contracts, another one (0) is for simple users. In the future, it is possible to add more simple workchains (1, 2, etc) to the blockchain. In turn, a workchain is split into shards (so-called shardchains). When the load is low, there are 16 shards. When it increases, shards split and when they decrease they merge. Blockchain is validated by validators. Part of them validate masterchain, others are split into groups and validate shardchains. Periodically, the global set of validators changes with elections. Within one election cycle, shardchain validators rotate as well.

External inbound messages help deploy and call contracts from outside. Internal messages allow contracts to communicate with each other. External outbound messages are the events the contracts produce for the outside world. Use them to implement some off-chain logic — subscribe for these messages and perform some off-chain actions whenever you receive them. For example, a simple value transfer can be initiated with an external inbound message (by developers or a service) or with an internal message from another contract. This message will produce a transaction (read below) and an internal message with value transfer. In order to learn what Messages are in detail, please follow this page.

"},{"title":"Introduction","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/arch/consensus/introduction","content":"Introduction This document was created when EverX started to reverse engineer a consensus protocol from publicly released source code of Telegram node as part of EverX Node implementation. We decided to release this document after the author of the protocol, Dr. Nikolai Durov, released a consensus outline 👉 https://test.ton.org/catchain.pdf and we highly recommend everybody read the original. In this research, we wanted to help other engineers and the general public to gain a better understanding of the underlying protocol, to provide more context by comparing it to other protocols and give more details about practical aspects of Catchain. Everscale consensus (dabbed Catchain by its author) is a Proof-of-stake consensus algorithm from a family of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithms. It includes the consensus algorithm as well as a protocol for message exchange between validator nodes in a network. BFT consensus is based on Byzantine Generals agreement and describes a problem of reaching a consensus in distributed system when each network participant does not have an information about the whole network and may not trust any of its participants. Blockchain consensus is a classical example of BFT problem as none of the block producers can be trusted or reachable at any given moment. Consensus lies at the core of any blockchain as it allows network nodes to agree on the next block in the blockchain without trusting each other. There are generally two classes of POS consensus algorithms. First (CBC Casper, Ouroboros, etc.) when block generation is very easy but forks are allowed with subsequent process of complex agreement on their resolution among the network participants. Catchain belongs to another class — the class of algorithms where block generation agreement is hard but forks are rare or impossible (PBFT, Tendermint, Algorand etc.) From a life-cycle perspective, the Catchain consensus includes the following stages: stake-based validator electionsvalidation session startupseveral block generation rounds Each block generation round has limited time and consists of several attempts. So, if validators fail to agree during all available attempts, the round is skipped and the new block is not committed to the blockchain. In the course of a round, validators exchange messages about block candidates generated by collators, validate these candidates, select vote candidates, vote for them and finally commit the elected block to the blockchain. To prevent consensus monopolization, the algorithm uses a round-robin role transfer from validator to the validator. So each round and each attempt several validators are assigned to generate blocks and one validator is assigned to propose a block for voting. As validators change roles from an attempt to attempt, the consensus mechanism cannot be blocked by a failure to get a decision from the majority of validators. The key idea here is to make sure that 2/3 of validator votes for a particular block are actually cast. The 2/3 cutoff threshold is a theoretical value that allows making sure that the decision via consensus is made. To improve the overall network performance, partial cross-node message synchronization is used. It means that any validator only interacts with a randomly selected subset of validators and uses data obtained from them to make a decision during a validation round. This data also includes aggregated transitive data received from other validators and signed by their signatures.","keywords":""},{"title":"Components","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/arch/consensus/components","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Validator Session Component​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Components","url":"/arch/consensus/components#validator-session-component","content":""},{"title":"Consensus Algorithm Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Components","url":"/arch/consensus/components#consensus-algorithm-overview","content":"To enable block validation, Everscale creates a list of validator nodes. This stage takes a fixed period of time configured in zerostate of blockchain. It is called validator session. This session is carried out in several rounds each aiming at generating a signed block. The list of validators for each validation session is regulated by a specific smart contract that implements the elections logic. Such validation session is established for a number of rounds each of which ends with block committing or round skip. As a result of elections the list of nodes with their respective voting weights is created. The voting weight is in direct proportion to a node stake value, so the larger the stake, the larger its weight. Then the weight is applied in decision making. Validator nodes vote by signing a block candidate with their own private keys. If a block gets at least 2/3 of all the weights (cutoff weight), it automatically wins the particular voting round. Every round has several stages: block candidate generationapprovalvotesigning A round ends once a new signed block appears. To prevent validator conflicts over a new block, each round includes a specific number of fixed-time attempts pre-configured in blockchain zerostate. If no consensus is achieved within the maximum number of attempts, the round is considered failed, the committed block is skipped and will not be written to a blockchain. In general case when validators fail to reach consensus for a few rounds, new validator election can resolve the deadlock. Each validator node stores the validation session state and synchronizes it with other nodes after each modification (i.e. creates a snapshot). Synchronization is implemented through the Catchain protocol by message broadcasting (i.e. increments to the snapshot are made). The details of synchronization are described below in the Сatchain protocol overview. Note that post-modification synchronization is not applied to all nodes, but to neighbor nodes. This subset is non constant and periodically updated, so this allows to minimize traffic between Catchain nodes and to deliver the node state transitively to all of them. The state validity is controlled through signature verification. The state consists of the current round state and of a list of previous round states (history of previous rounds). The round state, in turn, consists of the list of attempts and of signatures of the elected commit candidate block (pre-committed block). Finally, each round attempt includes the following steps: validator nodes exchange block candidates for approval;primary node for the current attempt sends the candidate block for voting to the rest of nodes (based on node priority computed for this attempt);validator nodes exchange votes.  It is noteworthy that to avoid deadlocks during voting and candidate generation, node priority is set depending on the number of nodes, round number, attempt number. So for each attempt priority changes and some validators gain privileges for the attempt. For example: priority to provide candidate blocks from a linked collator (only first validatorSessionOptions::round_candidate can propose a new candidate for approval);priority as ranging criteria for selecting candidates for approval process;priority to choose an approved block for voting (only one node can do it). Also, priority is used to calculate delay in the course of approval process during the round attempt (minimum priority corresponds to smaller delays for approval). Another evident and important point is that decision of each validator is checked by the rest of validators. Validator node public key is used for signature verification. At the start of each validator session each validator receives information about all other validators including: the list of validators pre-created by the smart contract so that nodes could be addressed by indexes during the session;public keys of each validator;validator weights according to their stakes. Each time a validator receives block candidates, approvals or votes from other validator nodes, it checks the signature (and in some cases priority as specified above) to make sure that:the sender is authorized to make the decision;the decision was actually made by the sender. "},{"title":"Consensus Stages​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Components","url":"/arch/consensus/components#consensus-stages","content":"The stages (slots) of a round are following: The stages (slots) of a round are following: Block candidate generation. Each node having block generation priority for the round generates a new block candidate which is requested from collator (see validatorsession::ValidatorSession::Callback::on_generate_slot for details). As soon as the candidate appears, it is sent to other validator nodes (validatorSession.candidate &gt; validatorSession.message.submittedBlock).Block candidates approval. Blocks from the previous stage are collected at each validator node and processed for approval. The approval process is not related to the consensus itself and is aimed at checking that blocks are not corrupted in terms of the bound data (see validatorsession::ValidatorSession::Callback::on_candidate of callback for details). As soon a block is approved, it is signed for approval by each validator. Then the validatorSession.message.approvedBlock message is broadcast with the round number and the ID of the approving node. So, each validator is aware which node has approved the sent block. The block is considered approved by a node when it receives 2/3 of approval messages.Voting attempts. Several block voting attempts are carried out. Each attempt is time limited and validators are supposed to fit into the slot. While votes for the current candidate are still accepted past the attempt deadline, it can cause a situation when two attempts result in different votes for multiple candidates, the case is considered further. The block candidate for voting is selected by the attempt’s main validator node and other nodes are notified by validatorSession.message.voteFor message (see ValidatorSessionRoundState::generate_vote_for for details; the main validator node which proposes the block for the attempt is provided by ValidatorSessionDescriptionImpl::get_vote_for_author method). The block selection involves two aspects: a) the node ranges approved blocks by nodes priority for the current attempt, so in each attempt the list is reordered, and b) the main validator node randomly selects a block for voting from this list. Each validator node processes the above-mentioned message and selects a block to vote for. A validator does not have to vote for the proposed block and is free to select another one. So the proposed block is more of a tip to provide an aim and to accelerate voting. Voting implies two things: a) signing block to mark it is voted by a particular validator node, and b) broadcasting this information in a validatorSession.message.vote message to the rest of validators. As soon as any approved block gets at least 2/3 of total validator weights in the course of voting, it becomes the candidate for signing (pre-commit block). Chances are that votes are received after the attempt end. In this case the late votes are processed simultaneously with the new attempt. Generally, votes for each finished attempt may be accepted past deadline; constituting no logical error, it allows finishing the round faster. And, if any of previous attempts ends up getting 2/3 of total weights or more even past its deadline, it still yields a new pre-commit candidate. In case of a conflict where two attempts propose different pre-commit blocks, the latest prevails. It is noteworthy that for performance reasons, a block vote obtained in one attempt is reused on the rest of attempts automatically.Block committing. As soon as a round attempt yields a pre-committed block, the signing process starts. The validator that gets a pre-committed block in the current round signs it and broadcasts to other validators using a validatorSession_message_commitmessage (see ValidatorSessionImpl::check_sign_slot and related logic in ValidatorSessionImpl::process_blocks for details). All other validators receive the broadcast, check the sender signature and update their state (see ValidatorSessionRoundState::action(…, validatorSession_message_commit for details). At some moment, a particular validator gets not less than 2/3 signatures from other validators (in terms of validator weights). This leads to a) switching to a new round (increasing the round sequence number by 1), and b) committing the signed block to the blockchain (see validatorsession::ValidatorSession::Callback::on_block_committed for details). In case of failure to get a signed block during the configured number of attempts (ValidatorSessionOptions::max_round_attempts), a new round starts and the failed one is marked as skipped (see validatorsession::ValidatorSession::Callback::on_block_skipped).

Also, it may be sent at a start of Catchain execution on each validator for all blocks approved this validator approved as candidates to Catchain (from validator get_blocks_approved_by and get_approved_candidate). This message initiates blocks approval if received in a broadcast and has the following structure: src : int256 - validator which has generated a block-candidate;round : int - number of a round where block-candidate appears;root_hash : int256 - root hash of block-candidate;data : bytes - block-candidate data;collated_data : bytes - block-candidate collated data. IV. Queries: validatorSession.downloadCandidate messages is used as broadcast to request a round block-candidate with a specific identifier. A validator generates it, if it has no block candidate for further consensus processing. Request: round : int - number of the round where block-candidate appears;id : validatorSession.candidateId - block-candidate identifier. Side effect: validatorSession.candidate - block-candidate is sent as an event during the request processing.

This synchronization is bi-directional: The validator-initiator sends a list containing delivered blocks heights (including vector timestamps, according to “Catchain Consensus: An Outline”). The validator expects to either receive absent blocks or a fork event notification in response. In the case of confirmed forking, consensus will blame the validator and discard all messages. Only the current validator can verify forking. Validator compares it’s own block heights list with the received list and sends the difference, if any, to the requester.

Each synchronization adds information about states of other validators, making the next consensus iteration possible on the validator. "},{"title":"Blocks Processing​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Catchain Overview","url":"/arch/consensus/overview#blocks-processing","content":"There are several types of blocks in the catchain: blocks written to a blockchain;catchain blocks with a state of the particular validator (CatchainReceivedBlock). They are the messages with source validator number identification, consensus algorithm iteration number (height) and consensus increment messages; CatchainReceivedBlock are the temporal sources for consensus blocks creation (CatchainBlock);CatchainBlock blocks built from several CatchainReceivedBlock blocks(CatchainBlock consists of CatchainReceivedBlock blocks states with maximal known height for a validator ). The CatchainReceivedBlock block consists of the following: catchain session identifier (to exclude the case when blocks from the previous catchain session are processed);number of the block origin source validator;block height (it is equal to the consensus algorithm iteration number for a particular validator);fork number (if several forks from the same validator are detected, the chain of blocks is invalidated and the validator is blamed);previous block sent to other validators (outgoing block);dependent blocks received by other validators (incoming blocks); note, that an incoming block cannot depend on two blocks from the same source validator; in general, this is a DAG. The dependent blocks graph allows for: recursively downloading of all blocks required for the full state of the processed block;recursively marking a subgraph of blocks as an invalid if forks are detected from a particular source validator. Each validator contains a list of states of other validators. Each of them stores CatchainReceivedBlock blocks that came from them. Every new incoming CatchainReceivedBlock block is checked regardless of which data channel it came from (directly from the validator or transitively, see CatChainReceiverImpl::validate_block_sync). If the block signature does not match the expected signature of the sender validator, or if the block is invalid, the block is ignored. The validator checks each catchain validator for forks. Only one fork per validator is allowed. In case when the same validator sends two different blocks with the same height, it is marked as a blamed and all CatChainReceivedBlockImpl corresponding to this validator are invalidated. The validator itself ignore till the end of the current catchain session. After the CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block is received, its processing is initiated (see CatChainReceiverImpl::receive_block). Then it is recorded to the database. The processing procedure downloads all dependents for the block and further adding the block to a queue of blocks ready to be run. This download procedure is done each 2-3 seconds by synchronization with other validators which are being asked for absent CatChainReceivedBlockImpl blocks. When any data updates are received (from the database during initialization, when new blocks are received, and while adding new blocks after the work of the consensus algorithm (see CatChainImpl::processing_block)), the CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block execution procedure is launched. Each validator contains state lists for other validators. Each of them stores CatchainReceivedBlock blocks received from others. Every new incoming CatchainReceivedBlock block is checked regardless of which data channel it came from (directly from the validator or transitively, see CatChainReceiverImpl::validate_block_sync). Validator ignores the block if the block signature does not match the expected signature of the sender validator or if the block is invalid. The active validator checks each catchain validator for forks. Only one fork per validator is allowed. In case the same validator sends two different blocks with the same height, catchain marks it as blamed and all CatChainReceivedBlockImpl blocks corresponding to this validator are invalidated. Consensus mechanics then ignore the validator itself until the end of the current catchain session. Receiving the CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block initiates the processing (see CatChainReceiverImpl::receive_block) and creates a database entry. The processing procedure downloads all dependents for the block. At the next step, it adds the block to a queue of blocks ready to be run. The download procedure is done every 2-3 seconds through synchronization with other validators required to provide absent CatChainReceivedBlockImpl blocks. The CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block execution procedure initiates whenever any data updates are received (from the database during initialization, when new blocks are received, and while adding new blocks after the work of the consensus algorithm (see CatChainImpl::processing_block)). Block execution includes: creating a fork from the existing previous block (in this case, blame procedure initialization is possible if the fork already exists);preliminary procedures for processing the block (pre_deliver);processing of the block. Pre-processing of a CatChainReceivedBlockImpl includes checking forks (see CatChainReceivedBlockImpl::pre_deliver). Block processing (see CatChainReceivedBlockImpl::delivery) includes the following: deliver_block — notification that the block is ready for this validator. This notification consists of: Notifying all neighbors about the appearance of a new CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block;Generating a new CatchainBlock block and placing it on the top of the chain from the validator that sent the corresponding CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block. The CatchainBlock block used in the consensus algorithm is a copy (snapshot) of the corresponding CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block excluding the data used for dependencies downloading process; dep_delivered — all dependent CatChainReceivedBlockImpl blocks (outgoing dependency) notification. This places dependents into a queue of blocks ready to be run;block_delivered — internal data update on validator-initiator (CatchainReceivedBlockImpl sender) sent blocks. CatchainBlock blocks received from the validator are the input for the consensus algorithm. Structurally, this block is very similar to the CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block. However, it contains all the data necessary for further processing (unlike CatChainReceivedBlockImpl, where some data may be missing). Catchain stores a list of the CatchainBlock top blocks — one for each validator — and runs the consensus algorithm periodically by the timer at the beginning of work and on-demand (see CatChainImpl::send_process for the details). The consensus iteration identification for each validator is the height of a block that the consensus algorithm generated. Thus, a pair (validator number, block height) uniquely identifies the block for a particular validator. Processing consensus results of one validator on another validator might result in two different blocks with the same height and validator numbers. This will result in fork appearance and identification key will extend to (validator number, block height, fork number). However, since catchain does not allow forks, the source validator where forked block originated will be blamed. So the fork number may be skipped and CatchainBlock may be identified identification may using (validator number, block height). The consensus iteration begins by selecting a random subset from the list of CatchainBlock top blocks (no more than max_dept=4) and passing them to the consensus algorithm described above (see ValidatorSessionImpl::process_blocks). Note that a separate validator sent each such block and there can’t be two blocks from a single validator. These blocks merge within the consensus algorithm, and a new CatchainBlock appears on their basis. Catchain reports this block appearance (see CatchainImpl::processed_block). Adding a new block leads to writing it into the database and creating a CatChainReceivedBlockImpl block from it, further sent to neighbors.

Transactions itself are complex processes, and fees are paid relative to different stages of executing them. In this document, we explain how the fees are calculated. We shall define transaction_fee as a sum of all fees for a single transaction. transaction_fee = inbound_external_message_fee + storage_fees + gas_fees + total_action_fees + outbound_internal_messages_fee  Where: inbound_external_message_fee — is deducted, if an inbound external message is imported in the transaction. storage_fees — storage costs since the moment of the last transaction. gas_fees — include all gas fees associated with the transaction. You can find more info in the Gas calculation basics section. total_action_fees — fees for performing send message actions. outbound_internal_messages_fee — is calculated as a sum of fees for all outbound internal messages generated by the transaction. Depending on the nature of the transaction, all of these except storage fees may not be applicable. Below we examine these types of fees in detail. Note: Block creation fee is not to be confused with the fees discussed in this document. Block creation fee is the new coins minted by the elector contract and distributed among validators as reward for creating blocks. It is not part of transaction fees. "},{"title":"Storage fees​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Fees","url":"/arch/fee-calculation#storage-fees","content":"Every transaction in Everscale has a storage phase that implies a certain storage fee charged on an account balance. This fee is charged for the period between transactions and is calculated according to the following formula: storage_fees = CEIL( ( account.bits * global_bit_price + account.cells * global_cell_price ) * period / 2 ^ 16 )  Where: account.bits and account.cells — stand for a number of bits and cells in the Account structure represented as tree of cells (including code and data). global_bit_price — is a global configuration parameter (p18 for both masterchain and workchains), price for storing one bit. global_cell_price — another global configuration parameter (p18 for both masterchain and workchains), price for storing one cell. period — number of seconds since previous storage fee payment. Note: While account.bits are generally easy to estimate, the account.cells value can vary greatly for different types of data. A cell can contain no more than 1023 bits and 4 references to other cells. Contract code and numerical variables tend to be packed into cells effectively, resulting in mostly full cells, and thus a minimal number of cells needed to store the data. More complex data structures can be packed into cells less efficiently, taking up more cells to store the same amount of data. Example: Let's calculate a minimal fee for storing 1KB of data for the duration of one day on a workchain: global_bit_price = 1 global_cell_price = 500 period = 86400 seconds account.bits = 8192 The minimal account.cells value for 8192 bits of data is 9 (rounding 8192/1023 up to the nearest integer). Thus the minimum storage fee would be calculated as follows: storage_fees = CEIL( ( 8192 * 1 + 9 * 500 ) * 86400 / 65536 ) = 16733 nanotokens = 0.000016733 tokens  Real storage fees for 1KB account can be higher, depending on the specific features of the contract. If the account balance is less than the due storage fee, the account is frozen and its balance is subtracted from storage fee and reduced to zero. Remaining storage fee is stored in account as debt.

Root cell is not counted. lump_price, bit_price, cell_price are contained in global config parameters p24 and p25, and can and can only be changed by a vote of validators. Note: Like in storage fees, msg.bits are generally easy to estimate, while the msg.cells value can vary for different types of messages. Example: Let's calculate a minimal forward fee for sending a 1KB message on a workchain: lump_price = 10000000 bit_price = 655360000 cell_price = 65536000000 To calculate msg.bits we subtract the root cell bits from the total message bits. For this example we'll assume that the root cell is filled completely (usually this is not the case, and the subtracted value is smaller, which results in a higher fee): msg.bits = 8192 - 1023 = 7169  To calculate msg.cells we subtract the root cell from the total umber of cells. The minimal number of cells in a 1 KB message is 9 (rounding 8192/1023 up to the nearest integer). Thus msg.cells is calculated as follows: msg.bits = 9 - 1 = 8  The minimum forward fee for a 1KB message would be calculated as follows: msg_fwd_fee = ( 10000000 + CEIL( ( 655360000 * 7169 + 65536000000 * 8 ) / 65536 ) ) = 89690000 nanotokens = 0.08969 tokens  Real forward fees for 1 KB messages may be higher, depending on the type and contents of the message.

Outbound messages​ outbound_internal_messages_fee is calculated as a sum of outbound internal message fees for every message generated as result of transaction execution: outbound_internal_messages_fee = SUM( out_int_msg.header.fwd_fee + out_int_msg.header.ihr_fee )  Where out_int_msg.header.fwd_fee is a part of the standard forward fee for the outbound internal message. out_int_msg.header.ihr_fee is currently disabled. Routing​ The forward fee for outbound internal message is split into int_msg_mine_fee and int_msg_remain_fee: msg_forward_fee = int_msg_mine_fee + int_msg_remain_fee  Where: int_msg_mine_fee = msg_forward_fee * first_frac / 2 ^ 16  first_frac — is contained in global config parameters p24 and p25, and determines the fraction of the fee, that the current set of validators receive. Note: Current global configuration can be always reviewed on ever.live in the master config section of the latest key block details (example) FIXME broken link. int_msg_mine_fee then becomes part of transaction action fees (see below). The remaining int_msg_remain_fee is placed in the header of outbound internal message (becoming out_int_msg.header.fwd_fee) and will go to validators who will process the message. If, while being forwarded to the destination address, the message passes through additional validator sets (i.e. if the validator set changes more than once while the message is being forwarded), a part of out_int_msg.header.fwd_fee is payed to the relevant validator set every time and the remaining fee in the message header is reduced by this amount: intermediate_fee = out_int_msg.header.fwd_fee * next_frac / 2 ^ 16  next_frac — is contained in global config parameters p24 and p25, and determines the fraction of the remaining forward fee, that intermediary validators receive. Note: Current global configuration can be always reviewed on ever.live in the master config section of the latest key block details (example) FIXME broken link. Note: Length of route does not affect the initial calculation of the forward fee. The fee is simply split between all involved validators according to global config parameters. Note: If an exception is thrown, and a bounce message is generated, it is subject to fees, just like a single regular outbound message. Inbound external messages​ Whenever an inbound external message needs to be imported for transaction execution, the for this action fee is calculated according to the standard forwarding fee formula, and paid to the current validators.

When gr becomes negative or if contract terminates with gc &gt; 0, an out of gas exception is triggered. Gas prices​ As stated in A.1 of the TVM specification. According to the original TON, for most primitives gas is calculated according to the following formula: Pb:=10+bPb := 10 + bPb:=10+b where b is the instruction length in bits. The same is true for EverX implementation. For example: the gas required for A0 (ADD) instruction is 10 + 8 = 18 gas, while the gas for A6cc (ADDCONST cc) instruction is 10 + 16 = 26 gas. For some instructions this rule does not apply. TVM specification lists either total gas prices, or prices in addition to the basic Pb for them explicitly. Instruction list with additional information may be obtained in A.2 through A.13 of the TVM specification. Apart from integer constants, the following expressions may appear: The total price of loading cells. Currently it is 100 gas units per cell. Reloading a cell again now costs 25 gas units.The total price of creating new Cells from Builders. Currently it is 500 gas units.Exception throwing. 50 gas units per exception.Exiting the block costs 5 gas units per implicit RET. Jumping to the first link costs 10 gas units - implicit JUMP.Moving to a new continuation with transferring parameters costs gas if there are more then 32 parameters. It costs N-32 gas, where N is the number of parameters.Tuple gas price. 1 gas unit for every tuple element. Note: that the most expensive operations are dictionary read/write operations. Dictionaries are stored in the form of trees of cells, where each cell can only be linked to four others. As result, these trees can grow quite large, depending on the data that needs to be stored. To read data in any cell, all its parent cells need to be read first, at the price of 100 gas per cell, and to write data in a cell, similarly all its parent cells need to be (re)created at the price of 500 gas per cell. Global gas limits​ Global gas limits are values stored in the masterchain configuration contract. Global values are standard and do not change at contract deployment. Only validator consensus can modify them. The values currently used can always be reviewed on ever.live in the latest key block details (example FIXME broken link). p20 config parameter values are used for masterchain and p21 values are used for workchain. Gas-related TVM primitives​ These is the list of official TVM primitives used for gas-related operations: F800 — ACCEPT, sets current gas limit gl to its maximal allowed value gm, and resets the gas credit gc to zero, decreasing the value of gr by gc in the process. In other words, the current smart contract agrees to buy some gas to finish the current transaction. This action is required to process external messages, which bring no value (hence no gas) with themselves.F801 — SETGASLIMIT (g – ), sets current gas limit gl to the minimum of g and gm, and resets the gas credit gc to zero. If the gas consumed so far (including the present instruction) exceeds the resulting value of gl, an (unhandled) out of gas exception is thrown before setting new gas limits. Notice that SETGASLIMIT with an argument g ≥ 2 63 − 1 is equivalent to ACCEPT.F802 — BUYGAS (x – ), computes the amount of gas that can be bought for x nanotokens, and sets gl accordingly in the same way as SETGASLIMIT.F804 — GRAMTOGAS (x – g), computes the amount of gas that can be bought for x nanotokens. If x is negative, returns 0. If g exceeds 2 63−1, it is replaced with this value.F805 — GASTOGRAM (g – x), computes the price of g gas in nanotokens.F806–F80F — Reserved for gas-related primitives. These are yet to be released. Note: F802, F804, F805 are not implemented in Telegram TON node. In Evernode, the general gas formula is the same as specified by TON specifications. Overall, Evernode operate in compliance with the specification. For every executed primitive, the amount of gas is added to the virtual machine according to the specification formula. Gas value for every primitive is based on gr. "},{"title":"Gas initialization types​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Fees","url":"/arch/fee-calculation#gas-initialization-types","content":"1. Calling contract from another contract​ An internal message with a balance value is received. In this case, the following formulas are applied to determine limits: gm = MIN(account balance / gas price, global_gas_limit) gl = MIN(message value / gas price, global_gas_limit) gc = 0 gr = gc + gl  By default, gas costs are allocated to the caller contract that triggers the transaction with a message. Accepting is also available for internal contracts. If ACCEPT is not called, gas is taken from the caller contract according to the message value. In other words, the message value defines the current limit. The message value determines the starting TVM gas limit. So, to put it plain, if ACCEPT is not called, the message pays, if ACCEPT is used, additional gas can be bought by the target contract. This approach enables flexible contract design where either total gas is paid by the caller contract (but in this case it has to have enough gas at any moment of time) or the target contract also incurs costs. 2. Offchain contract call​ External messages do not carry balance values. In this case, the values are calculated according to the following formulas: gm = MIN(account balance / gas price, global_gas_limit) gl = 0 gc = MIN(gm, global_gas_credit) gr = gc + gl  As external messages have no gas value, gas is credited to execute it. Target contracts have to cover costs by calling Accept to buy gas. If a contract returns an exception before the credit is given, no gas fee applies. As the public code for node has just been released this documentation is likely to be updated. Managing Gas in Solidity Some Theory Anyone can send external message to your contract. When a message arrives, the contract initial gas limit is equal to 10,000 units of credit gas that should be bought later by the ACCEPT TVM primitive. Otherwise when credit gas falls to zero, the TVM throws the out of gas exception. The contract is supposed to spend these 10,000 units of 'free' gas to check the body of an inbound message tp make sure that it is valid and can be processed by contract successfully. The idea of credit gas allowance is that as long as it is beyond zero, any exception thrown by contract prevents all further gas charges. But once the contract accepts a message, all gas consumed by contract is converted to gas fees regardless of whether a transaction is aborted or not. ACCEPT is useful in internal messages too. When another contract sends an internal message to your contract, initial gas limit is equal to an inbound message value divided by the gas_price or global gas limit, if it is smaller. If this value is not enough to finish execution, the contract then can increase its gas limit by calling ACCEPT or SETGASLIMIT primitive. The ACCEPT primitive increases the limit to the value of its balance divided by the gas_price, and the SETGASLIMIT primitive sets the current gas limit to the value popped from the TVM stack (the value cannot be bigger than the gm limit). With the ACCEPT command a contract can choose whether gas for its execution is paid by the caller contract or by the contract itself. Implementation In EverX the ACCEPT primitive is implemented in Solidity as a private function called by public functions. Find below actual usage examples. All can be compiled using EverX Solidity compiler. Accept gas inside function To avoid gas payment when the foo function is called by another contract, we can use the following code: Remember that the caller contract should attach enough tokens to its message to cover all gas that will be spend by foo function. Accept gas inside modifier contract AcceptExample2 { uint _sum = 0; modifier AlwaysAccept() { tvm.accept(); _; } function foo(uint a, uint b) AlwaysAccept() public { _sum = a + b; } }  Important: modifier is called before arguments are deserialized from inbound message body. In the example above AlwaysAccept() will be called before a and b are decoded.

This may change after a new consensus. There is a workchain -1, this is the master chain, it is validated by the validators with the largest stake. Contracts can be deployed in the -1 workchain, but it is more expensive, and it was made mainly for governorship. (Probably in the future there will be no user contracts) There is a workchain 0, where contracts are mostly located. More workchains will be launched in the future. Workchains are further divided into Processing threads. There is a workchain parameter that indicates the minimum number of processing threads, and currently it is 16 for a 0 workchain. Thread processing is an interesting concept. In ES, only computation is shared between the validators of the same workchain, but they all have the same storage. Let’s look at what that means and how it works. For example, we have 160 validators for the 0 workchain. They are randomly divided into 16 groups of 10 validators, and each gets its own Processing thread. All workchain contracts are also divided into 16 groups, simply by address ranges. (0.00 - 0:08, 0:08 - 0.18, etc.). Each group of validators executes transactions only for their group of smart contracts, and releases blocks of their processing thread. But at the same time, they are constantly downloading blocks of other processing threads in order to see their outgoing and incoming message queues. At the same time, blocks are not a list of transactions that need to be rolled up, but a list of incoming messages + a state delta. So, when you download a block of another processing thread, you do not have to do computation in order to update your state. You’re just rolling state changes. How roughly works: The Masterchain generates block 1.All threads download the last master block.Threads create their own block and register it in the master block.The masterchain generates block 2, which contains the hashes of all blocks of threads that have registered in it.All threads download masterblock 2.All threads look at the hashes of the registered blocks of other threads, and download them all.All threads generate a block.This process gets repeated. Message delivery guarantees also work in this way. When you create a message, it is placed on that thread’s outgoing queue: Thread A generates a message for the contract that is in thread B, and creates a block with a new outgoing message in the outgoing queue.Thread A is registered in the master block.The masterchain generates a block.Thread B downloads the master block, and downloads the block of thread A registered there.Thread B sees the message in thread A and imports it into its inbound queue. (When a message is imported, it is immediately executed (transaction starts) If there is not enough gas for a transaction in the current block, then the message is simply not imported, and waits for its turn in another block. At the same time, there is a message import order, so that validators will not be able to ignore it forever).Thread B creates a block with a message in the incoming queue, and registers with the master.Thread A downloads the block in which it sees its message in thread B’s incoming queue and removes the message from its outgoing queue since it was delivered successfully.Generally, thread A generates a block, then registers it in the master block. Then thread B downloads it, sees that thread A has removed it from its outgoing queue, and deletes it from its incoming one. In fact, sharding in this blockchain is the sharding of computational resources. And the data is the same for everyone, with the expectation that all validators have gigabit channels, and we rest only on computation. If some processing thread is heavily loaded with the last N blocks, then it will split into two, and new processing threads can also split in turn. Then when the load drops, they all merge.

CTR encryption turns block ciphers, such as AES, into stream ciphers to make a bit-flipping attack possible. In case the attacker is in possession of the plaintext which belongs to an encrypted datagram, he can easily obtain a pure keystream. Then, XOR it with his own plaintext and replace the message which was sent by a peer. We remember that buffer integrity is protected by a SHA-256 hash. However, an attacker can replace it too. This is because knowing a full plaintext means knowing its hash. The nonce field is there to prevent such an attack. No attacker can replace the SHA-256 without knowing the nonce.

Replay protection If a message is processed and added into an accepted block, then the same message (that is, the message with the same hash) will not be collated for some time period. If the message has some expiration time (corresponding to the time period), then this effectively makes efficient replay protection. 2. No messages are lost You only need to send the message once. If there will be a possibility to accept it and add it to a block, then it will be done. Message loss may occur only for blockchain overloading reasons. 3. One can trace the message processing. There are several checkpoints on the message processing path (when validators received the message, when message was added to a block, when the block was finalized, etc). Upon reaching certain checkpoints one can predict that the message will be successfully processed with a high accuracy - most messages can be considered to be processed when validators acknowledge that they were received (this happens in 100-200 ms; after that it’s highly unlikely that the message is declined). Thus, depending on the message importance one may trade efficiency for reliability in the software, choosing not to trace further processing results. On the other hand, if a transaction is really important, then you can wait till the block with the transaction result is issued.

Message flow in REMP can be seen on the following diagram:  A message from the user application is sent to a REMP Client (e.g., it could be some Full Node; also the user application may implement the necessary protocol by itself). The client in turn sends the message to its shard validators. The validators, aside from processing the message, gather info about message validation status and send it back to the REMP Client and then further to the user (such messages are called “receipts”). "},{"title":"REMP Catchain​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Reliable External Messaging Protocol","url":"/arch/networking/remp#remp-catchain","content":"The validators exchange info between them using a special REMP Catchain protocol.

When validator Catchain sessions are started/stopped/split/merged/etc, the same happens with related REMP Catchain session. When the validator session expires, all messages being processed are transferred to the next REMP Catchain session. There is some significant difference between validation and REMP Catchain sessions. Validator Catchain session is shared among validators that are currently validating the given shard. REMP Catchain session is shared among validators that are currently validating the given shard and validators that validated this shard in the previous session. So number of participants in REMP Catchain session is about two times bigger than in validator Catchain session. The reason for this is the necessity to pass RMQ data between sessions with respect to practical network bandwidth. So each newly created REMP Catchain session will contain validators from previous validator Catchain session that will provide reliable RMQ data handover for validators from current validator Catchain session.

So, the message processing may result in three outcomes: accepted by collator - and then validated - and included into shard block - and the block is included into masterchain (accept, finalized)rejected by fullnode before processing - or by all collators (reject)timeout - its collation/validation attempts were fruitless, and the message became obsolete. This gives hard replay protection guarantees (if message has expiration mechanism included — making the message obsolete before two catchains are switched), and soft processing guarantees (message collation/validation attempts may be fruitless if the message is wrong, or if the blockchain is overloaded). "},{"title":"Replay protection in more detail​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Reliable External Messaging Protocol","url":"/arch/networking/remp#replay-protection-in-more-detail","content":"Traditional approaches to replay protection in Everscale usually require some mutable structures in the contract: sequence counter (updated each time the message is sent), previous messages’ hash table, or something similar. REMP keeps track of all messages accepted by the Blockchain and avoids repeated collation, even if the message is sent several times — thus REMP replay protection mechanism is similar to hash table method, although it is transparent for user and does not consume any gas. A bit more detail about the mechanism. All messages from accepted blocks are parsed and their id’s are kept in Message Cache on each node (think of this as about some extended Shard State).Collator requests the Cache for each message proposed for collation (and, of course, messages’ collation is refused if they were already included into some accepted block).After each session all old messages (that is, messages which were added two master sessions earlier or more) are removed from the Cache. Thus, expiration time must be specified in messages, so that the messages removed from the Cache should be already invalid by that moment. And a bit more about expiration time fine-tuning. The session lifetime is specified in Blockchain config parameter 28 (field mc_catchain_lifetime), traditional value for this config is 250 seconds, current value should be checked in network configuration.The message is tracked by Remp during two consecutive master sessions — the session the message arrived, and the next one (exception: when master sessions are shorter than specified in config, then the message is remembered longer, until total session lifetime exceeds twice of mc_catchain_lifetime; such shorter sessions can happen, for example, when a keyblock is issued).Sessions switch according to their own schedule. So, it is quite possible that the message arrives just seconds before the first session ends. As shown on the diagram above, Message 1 arrives in the beginning of the first session, and Message 3 arrives just moments before session switching. So, actual time of message tracking in Remp is between mc_catchain_lifetime and mc_catchain_lifteme*2, and expiration time should not exceed mc_catchain_lifetimeOn another hand, according to testing on real networks, it is unreasonable to have expiration time smaller than 40 seconds (or a minute), since a message may expire too soon, before it receives a second chance for collation. The message can easily miss its first collation due to blockchain overfilling, session switching, etc. "},{"title":"Message statuses​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Reliable External Messaging Protocol","url":"/arch/networking/remp#message-statuses","content":"During validation, a message processing passes through several stages (that is, changes some statuses), and validator sends receipts about that. Some of them are given on the diagram below (as inscriptions near arrows). The statuses that are “final” (that is, nothing is happening after it) are shown in blue.  Since message is validated by several validators simultaneously, the statuses are reported by the validators separately, so some of them can be reported several times. E.g., one validator may decide that the message should be rejected, but other validators may decide just the opposite — so the user may receive “Rejected” and then “Finalized” for its message.

Sometimes, we intentionally omit details that are not relevant to the Transaction Executor, requiring much wider context to be explained. The specification part is presented in two flavors. When the precision is required, we describe the behavior by providing the pseudo-code implementing some algorithm. For more general properties, we formulate them in a form of semi-formal statements about the system behavior. By comparison to the program implementation, the specification pseudo-code overapproximates the implementation by throwing away non-relevant parts of the logic, for example: sophisticated error handling, non-interesting parts of the state being removed, introducing reasonable assumptions that greatly simplifies the logic, etc. In other words, the pseudo-code shows how the system behaves for its significant parts, putting away everything else.

The fee amount is calculated using the formula: fee=(cells∗prices.cell_price+bits∗prices.bit_price)∗Δfee = (cells * prices.cell\\_price + bits * prices.bit\\_price) * \\Deltafee=(cells∗prices.cell_price+bits∗prices.bit_price)∗Δ Δ\\DeltaΔ — the time interval between now and the latest payment moment, measured in seconds. Here, we assume that storage prices stay constant during the Δ\\DeltaΔ interval. The storage fee gets charged on each message processing storage_phase. For greater flexibility, the storage prices may be changed depending on the current supply/demand situation. It is done by negotiating new blockchain config parameters prices.cell_priceprices.cell\\_priceprices.cell_priceand prices.bit_priceprices.bit\\_priceprices.bit_price among validators. After validators accept it, new parameters are written in the Masterchain config smart-contract. After the change, previous price parameters do no get lost. The whole history of storage price changes is stored in the config. It is done to provide precise calculation of the storage fee that take into account all the price changes during the interval of calculation. Data Storage Fee Calculation​ Here we describe the storage fee calculation expression in its generality. Lets assume we have the following list of prices equipped with a timestamp of a moment when the price change took place: T={t0,t1,...,tN}T = \\{ t_0, t_1, ..., t_N \\}T={t0​,t1​,...,tN​} Pr=⟨(pr0,t0),(pr1,t1),...,(prN,tN)⟩Pr = \\langle (pr_0, t_0), (pr_1, t_1), ..., (pr_N, t_N) \\ranglePr=⟨(pr0​,t0​),(pr1​,t1​),...,(prN​,tN​)⟩ Here, pr_0 is reserved for the initial prices set in the genesis block of the blockchain, and t0t_0t0​ is a timestamp of those initial prices being set. Let now denote the current timestamp, i.e. the moment of time when we want to calculate the storage fee, measured in Unix Epoch. Its value is always greater or equal than the most recent price change timestamp. Let last_paid denote the timestamp of the latest storage payment. If the payment didn't take place, last_paid=0last\\_paid = 0last_paid=0. To simplify the calculation formula, let us introduce a new listPr′Pr'Pr′, such that: Pr′=⟨(prk,tk),...,(prN,tN)⟩Pr' = \\langle (pr_k, t_k), ..., (pr_N, t_N) \\ranglePr′=⟨(prk​,tk​),...,(prN​,tN​)⟩ where t_k is the least timestamp among values t1...tNt_1 ... t_Nt1​...tN​ that is greater than last_paid. tk=min{ti∣ti∈T∧ti&gt;last_paid}t_k = min \\{ t_i | t_i \\in T \\land t_i &gt; last\\_paid \\}tk​=min{ti​∣ti​∈T∧ti​&gt;last_paid} In other words, the values tk,...,tNt_k, ..., t_Ntk​,...,tN​ form a subset ofT where each value is strictly greater than last_paid. We also add two more elements from the left and the right: Pr′′=⟨(prk,last_paid)⟩⋅Pr′⋅⟨(prN,now)⟩Pr'' = \\langle (pr_k, last\\_paid) \\rangle \\cdot Pr' \\cdot \\langle (pr_N, now) \\ranglePr′′=⟨(prk​,last_paid)⟩⋅Pr′⋅⟨(prN​,now)⟩ Here, dot operator denotes lists concatenation operation. We use the following shortcuts: pri=fst(Pri′′)pr_i = fst(Pr''_i)pri​=fst(Pri′′​) the first element of a two-element tuple, and ti=snd(Pri′′)t_i = snd(Pr''_i)ti​=snd(Pri′′​), the second element. The total storage fee for the time interval is: total_storage_fee=∑i=1..∣Pr′′∣(cells∗pri.cell_price+bits∗pri.bits_price)∗(ti−ti−1)total\\_storage\\_fee = \\sum_{i=1..|Pr''|}{(cells * pr_{i}.cell\\_price + bits * pr_{i}.bits\\_price) * (t_i - t_{i-1})}total_storage_fee=∑i=1..∣Pr′′∣​(cells∗pri​.cell_price+bits∗pri​.bits_price)∗(ti​−ti−1​) Data Storage Fee Calculation Algorithm​ For greater convenience, besides having the formula, we provide the pseudo-code for the algorithm calc_storage_fee, implemented in imperative fashion.

It means that instead of producing huge smart-contract monoliths, it is encouraged to separate the system into many manageable smart-contracts that communicate with each other by means of message passing. The message passing scheme used in a system induces some protocol. If message passing breaks in an unexpected way, the whole protocol may stall, potentially leading to global system deadlocks. It is of utter importance to guarantee that all produced correct messages will be eventually delivered to the destination account.

This allows the parser to determine which scheme is in front of it if several options are possible. How to determine whether to serialize as boxed or not? If our schema is part of another schema, then we need to see how the field type is specified. If it is specified explicitly, then we serialize without a prefix. If not explicitly (there are many such types), then we need to serialize as boxed. Example: pub.unenc data:bytes = PublicKey; pub.ed25519 key:int256 = PublicKey; pub.aes key:int256 = PublicKey; pub.overlay name:bytes = PublicKey;  We have such types. If PublicKey is specified in the schema, for example, adnl.node id:PublicKey addr_list:adnl.AddressList = adnl.Node, then it is not explicitly specified and we need to serialize with the ID prefix (boxed).

It is worth mentioning that there is no storage phase if the transaction is sent to deploy a new smart contract. Credit phase - adding the value of the internal message received to the account's balance. Computing phase - starts when the smart contract code is invoked inside an instance of TVM with appropriate parameters, including the inbound message and the account's persistent data. The result of this phase is an exit code, new persistent data, and an action list, which includes outbound messages to be sent. Also, it may end up creating a new account, uninitialized or active, or activating a previously uninitialized or frozen account. The gas fee for computation is deducted from the account balance. Action phase - starts when the actions from the actions list are performed if the smart contract is executed successfully (with exit code 0 or 1). Suppose, it is impossible to perform all the actions. For example, because of insufficient funds to transfer with an outbound message. In that case, the transaction is terminated, and the account state is rolled back. Bounce phase - starts when a transaction is terminated. That is, the inbound message has its bounce flag set.

There are a few predefined types: # - means an unsigned 32-bit number## N - the same as uintN - means an unsigned N-bit number#&lt;= N - means a number between 0 and N (including both). Such a number is stored in ceil(log2(N+1)) bits.N * Bit - means N-bit slice^Cell - means an arbitrary cell in reference^[ field_definitions ] - means that field definitions are stored in the referenced cellType - stands for arbitrary type (but only presents in implicit definitions). type-expr usually consist of optionally parametrized Type only as: last_trans_lt:uint64 or _:StateInit. Yet, it is possible that type-expr also contains conditions. In that case, type-expr consists of ident, :, condition, ?, type. If a condition, which can refer to previously defined fields, renders to false, the corresponding field is not presented. For instance, prev:n?^(ProofChain n) means that prev field is only presented for objects when n&gt;0. Implicit​ Some fields may be implicit. Their definitions are surrounded by curly brackets. It indicates that the field is not actually present in the serialization. Their value must be deduced from some other data. Usually, the parameters of the type are being serialized. For instance nothing$0 {X:Type} = Maybe X; just$1 {X:Type} value:X = Maybe X;  Some other constructor may define the field var:(Maybe #). In that case, the variable will be serialized either as 1 bit and a serialization of # (uint32) if var is present or as 0 bit if var is absent. That way, Maybe is declared as a C++-like template type for arbitrary type X. However, if Maybe is declared as nothing$0 {X:#} = Maybe X;, that will mean that Maybe is declared for an arbitrary number (not totally arbitrary type X). Type definition​ A type name consists of [A-z0-9_] symbols. By practice, it is a CamelCase name. It can be parametrized by one or more parameters. In some cases, the variables are prefixed by a tilde (~). Basically, it means that, prior to deserialization, the exact value of that variable is not known. It will be computed during deserialization. Let's consider: unary_zero$0 = Unary ~0; unary_succ$1 {n:#} x:(Unary ~n) = Unary ~(n + 1);  In the case when we want to deserialize the Unary ~N object from the slice containing 0b1111111100101 bit string. Thus, when we intend to deserialize Unary ~N, it means that we do not know yet whether we deserialize Unary 0, Unary 7 or Unary 1020. We begin with 0b1111111100101 and compare it with the constructor prefixes 0b0 for unary_zero and 0b1 for unary_succ. We can see that we have unary_succ. However, the value of N cannot be deducted. It should be obtained from the deserialization of variable x. This variable has type Unary ~(N-1) and the value of N-1 can be deducted from the deserialization of the remaining bits in the slice. We get the remaining bits of the slice and try to deserialize Unary ~(N-1) and again see the unary_succ tag. We, therefore, recursively dive into Unary until we get to the Unary ~(N-8). Then, we see that the rest of the slice starts from the unary_zero tag and thus constitutes a Unary 0 object. Looking back, we can see that we initially had a Unary 8 object. After the deserialization of Unary ~N from Slice(0b1111111100101) we get a Unary 8 object and the remaining slice(0b0101) from which subsequent variables of the constructor can be deserialized. Constraints​ Some implicit fields may contain constraints, for instance {n &lt;= m}. It means that the previously defined variables n and m should satisfy the corresponding inequality. This inequality is an inherent property of the constructor. It should be checked during serialization and objects with variables which do not satisfy these constraints are invalid. An example of constructors with constraints: hml_short$0 {m:#} {n:#} len:(Unary ~n) {n &lt;= m} s:(n * Bit) = HmLabel ~n m; hml_long$10 {m:#} n:(#&lt;= m) s:(n * Bit) = HmLabel ~n m; hml_same$11 {m:#} v:Bit n:(#&lt;= m) = HmLabel ~n m;  "},{"title":"Deserialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"TL-B and BoC","url":"/arch/tlb-and-boc#deserialization","content":"With the help of TL-B schemes, any object can be serialized to the builder and deserialized from the slice. In particular, in order to deserialize an object, we need to start with the determination of the constructor. For this purpose we use a tag and then deserialize variables one by one from left to right. It is done recursively turning to the serialization of variables (they are TL-B objects). Throughout the serialization process we go the other way. Write to the builder tag which corresponds to a given object of that type and then, continue from left to right with each variable. "},{"title":"BoC​","type":1,"pageTitle":"TL-B and BoC","url":"/arch/tlb-and-boc#boc","content":"All data in ES is stored and sent in a structure called the BoC (Bag of cell). This is a confusing structure invented by Nikolai Durov, and it’s not very clear whether it was necessary in order to create the blockchain, or Nikolai over-engineered here. In general, all data stored in the contract (not the code, the code is separate, but also the BoC is stored in the contract :-)) is stored in one BoC, this is a given cell (TVMCell) with links to subcells. The TVMCell is a structure that has 1023 Bits of data and 4 references to its child cells. A cell reference is the HASH of that cell. With ES have have a singly connected graph, where each node can have 4 descendants. And we need to pack all smart contract data or messages into a cell with sub cells. Thank God, by using Ton Solidty and knowing the interfaces of contracts, you don’t have to manually pack and unpack cells. The compiler will do everything for you. However, there are rare cases when you will have to do it yourself. In order to do this, there are special primitives in Solidity. When this is necessary, you simply declare state variables in Solidity and read and write to them as usual. The compiler will pack and unpack everything in the BoC for you. Some BoC properties to understand. BoC is an acyclic graph. The link to a cell c is a hash of its data and its hash links to subcells. So we cannot create a cycle. (Because if we add a link from the parent cell to the child cell, then, by doing so, we recalculate all hashes from the changed cell to the root cell and the link to the parent cell changes). The entire state of the contract is BoC. This is one cell with as many child cells as you like. Ton Solidity takes care of work with states for us, but you need to understand that, because of ES’s tree structure, we normally don’t write contracts with a lot of data. In order to illustrate how it works, consider (schematically) how a dictionary could be implemented in BoC.  Each circle in the picture is a separate cell. To get the value by key 2, TVM needs to load a cell of depth 0, then depth 1 and then depth 2. We have to pay gas for each time a cell is loaded. And if we change the value by key two, we will need to recalculate all references from the cell with the value of the root cell because the cell reference is a hash (cell.data + cell.refs). So, links to all cells along the way will change and we will need to change them from bottom to top. So, the more elements our dictionary has, the deeper the cell will be and the more expensive it will be to work with. For a dictionary, the cost of gas will increase to O(log n) in a worst case scenario. (In reality, everything would be more complicated but O (log n) can be useful to look at as a worst case scenario). Now, if we are creating an ERC20 token, then the more owners this token has, the more expensive the gas will be to use this contract (the size of the owner-number map will grow). And although O(Log n) doesn’t sound scary at all, and the cost of working with the map will increase very, very slowly after the first hundred elements, and then even slower after that, in ES there we have a storage fee that grows linearly. If you have accounts in your ERC-20 token that contain pennies, then the fees for holding these accounts will greatly exceed the value of these accounts over the years. Therefore, in ES it is customary to make separate contracts for separate accounts, which themselves pay for their storage. Fun fact: this entire overcomplicated data storage scheme helps to scale the network, so that the validator can quickly execute smart contracts. Validators do not need to store the entire current state of the blockchain in Ram, because loading the smart contract state from the disk will be fast, since all smart contracts are small. Additionally, since all contracts are small, they are evenly distributed across all shards.

This may change after a new consensus. There is a workchain -1, this is the master chain, it is validated by the validators with the largest stake. Contracts can be deployed in the -1 workchain, but it is more expensive, and it was made mainly for governorship. (Probably in the future there will be no user contracts) There is a workchain 0, where contracts are mostly located. More workchains will be launched in the future. Workchains are further divided into Processing threads. There is a workchain parameter that indicates the minimum number of processing threads, and currently it is 16 for a 0 workchain. Thread processing is an interesting concept. In ES, only computation is shared between the validators of the same workchain, but they all have the same storage. Let’s look at what that means and how it works. For example, we have 160 validators for the 0 workchain. They are randomly divided into 16 groups of 10 validators, and each gets its own Processing thread. All workchain contracts are also divided into 16 groups, simply by address ranges. (0.00 - 0:08, 0:08 - 0.18, etc.). Each group of validators executes transactions only for their group of smart contracts, and releases blocks of their processing thread. But at the same time, they are constantly downloading blocks of other processing threads in order to see their outgoing and incoming message queues. At the same time, blocks are not a list of transactions that need to be rolled up, but a list of incoming messages + a state delta. So, when you download a block of another processing thread, you do not have to do computation in order to update your state. You’re just rolling state changes. How roughly works: The Masterchain generates block 1.All threads download the last master block.Threads create their own block and register it in the master block.The masterchain generates block 2, which contains the hashes of all blocks of threads that have registered in it.All threads download masterblock 2.All threads look at the hashes of the registered blocks of other threads, and download them all.All threads generate a block.This process gets repeated. Message delivery guarantees also work in this way. When you create a message, it is placed on that thread’s outgoing queue: Thread A generates a message for the contract that is in thread B, and creates a block with a new outgoing message in the outgoing queue.Thread A is registered in the master block.The masterchain generates a block.Thread B downloads the master block, and downloads the block of thread A registered there.Thread B sees the message in thread A and imports it into its inbound queue. (When a message is imported, it is immediately executed (transaction starts) If there is not enough gas for a transaction in the current block, then the message is simply not imported, and waits for its turn in another block. At the same time, there is a message import order, so that validators will not be able to ignore it forever).Thread B creates a block with a message in the incoming queue, and registers with the master.Thread A downloads the block in which it sees its message in thread B’s incoming queue and removes the message from its outgoing queue since it was delivered successfully.Generally, thread A generates a block, then registers it in the master block. Then thread B downloads it, sees that thread A has removed it from its outgoing queue, and deletes it from its incoming one. In fact, sharding in this blockchain is the sharding of computational resources. And the data is the same for everyone, with the expectation that all validators have gigabit channels, and we rest only on computation. If some processing thread is heavily loaded with the last N blocks, then it will split into two, and new processing threads can also split in turn. Then when the load drops, they all merge.","keywords":""},{"title":"Everscale Bug Bounty Program","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/contribute/bug-bounty-program","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Introduction​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Everscale Bug Bounty Program","url":"/contribute/bug-bounty-program#introduction","content":"Everscale is an asynchronous message passing system of stateful programmable agents called smart-contracts.

This pattern is well known and called Actor Model.","keywords":""},{"title":"Intro","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/develop/intro","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Distributed Programming approach​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intro","url":"/develop/intro#distributed-programming-approach","content":"Instead of writing contracts in which the state can continuously grow, we write distributed systems of smart contracts. For example TIP-3 token standard is designed as a system of main TokenRoot contract, which stores metadata, and has a function to deploy a separate smart-contract called TokenWallet for each token owner (that is what a wallet is) and can send tokens directly among contracts without a central hub. Important concept In Everscale, each contract address is a uniquely computed value. A contract address is a hash of the contract code and initial data (initial data is a value of static variables, and not what you pass to the constructor, since in Everscale the constructor is a function that you call after the deployment of the contract in one transaction). This is a very important pattern of distributed programming (as it is understood in Everscale). Knowing the code of a contract, and its initial data you can make sure that you are being called by a contract with the same parents as your own. Or, knowing the contract code and its initial data, you can compute the address of a contract on the fly and send messages to it. By creating small contracts for a single system (like in TIP-3 token) we solve a number of issues: All contracts end up in different shards which distributes the load evenly throughout the network.Contract states are very small. Validators can load them very quickly from a disk.Storage fee. If we had one contract with a huge hash map, then it would have to pay a large fee for its storage, and it is not clear who should pay and how for this storage. If there are many accounts with small balances that their owners no longer need, then naturally they will not pay for its storage, and the rest of the holders of this token will have to pay for all of the “remainders.” So that smart contract programmers do not have to think about how to force users to pay for storage or clean up old data inside the contract, Everscale has allowed each user to deploy their own contract. Each user determines how long they will pay for storage and can always adjust these parameters. "},{"title":"Contract Deployment​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intro","url":"/develop/intro#contract-deployment","content":"The concept about deterministic address calculations, described above, is also tied to how contracts are deployed in Everscale. The contract can naturally be deployed by another contract. But what should we do if we want to deploy a contract from outside? To do this, we have to take the contract code and its initial data, and compute its future address. After that, we simply send money there, with a bounce flag = false. And the money just stays on the address, which has no initialized code. Then we send a special external message to this address with the code and initial data, and we say “Look, here we have the code and initial data, the hash of which gives us this address, initialize it please” and the network initializes the contract.

It works with both Evercloud and DApp server. 1. Install Everdev $ npm install -g everdev  It requires NPM to be installed. If you experience any problems with installation, check out our troubleshooting section. 2. Configure network connection Everdev has a built-in network tool to manage your networks and access credentials. Using Evercloud endpoints Add your Evercloud endpoint to everdev and make it default: everdev network add networkName &lt;your-evercloud-endpoint&gt; everdev network default networkName  Using DApp Server endpoint If you are setting up a connection via your own DApp server, user the following command to add it to the network list (it will be named dappserver). everdev network add dappserver &lt;your_dapp_server_endpoint&gt;  To set your dappserver network as default, use the following command: everdev network default dappserver  3. Set a giver contract on your network On Everscale, you need to sponsor a contract address in advance to be able to deploy the contract. Everdev provides a way to set an account of your choice as a giver for deployment operations, so you will not have to do a separate step of sending tokens to a new contract address every time you deploy something. This contract can some multisig wallet, for example your Surf account. Note: To work automatically, the giver contract should have only one custodian. To set it up, first save the custodian keys of your giver account into a signer that will be used to sign giver transactions (Learn more about the signer tool here): everdev signer add giver_sign signer_secret_key_or_seed_phrase_in_quotes  Then add the giver address specifying the signer to be used with it. everdev network giver network_name giver_address --signer giver_sign --type giver_type  Where giver_type is the type of the giver contract you selected (GiverV1 | GiverV2 | GiverV3 | SafeMultisigWallet | MsigV2| SetcodeMultisigWallet) We recommend using Multisig 2.0 as giver, for that use MsigV2 giver_type. 4. Get wallet account contract files We recommend using Multisig 2.0 contracts as a wallet. They can be found here. In this guide SetcodeMultisig specifically is used. Download the contract files and place them in the working folder. Direct links to its files are as follows: .tvc - Compiled contract code SetcodeMultisig.tvc direct link: https://github.com/EverSurf/multisig2/raw/main/build/SetcodeMultisig.tvc .abi.json - application binary interface, describing the functions of the contract SetcodeMultisig.abi.json direct link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EverSurf/multisig2/main/build/SetcodeMultisig.abi.json Execute the commands of the following steps from the directory with the contract files. 5. Create wallet account signer To generate your wallet account signer enter the following command: everdev signer generate wallet_signer  Or, if you already have a seed phrase, add it like this: everdev signer add &quot;your-seed-phrase-here&quot;  To deploy multisig wallet account you will need to specify the public key of the signer. To view it, use the following command: everdev signer info wallet_signer  The keys will be displayed in terminal (if you imported the seed phrase, it will be displayed here as well): { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;wallet_signer&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;: { &quot;public&quot;: &quot;8f8779e7c1944b133a423df96d06ae770c996f19d63438dbf2f569a29529b248&quot;, &quot;secret&quot;: &quot;ce57d2666d0d2c737a03ca4e6cfa38c5ca088dbcef43eb0353896feca8aea2a5&quot; } }  Usually a single owner (with a single signer) per wallet account is optimal for any tasks that require automation. However, it is possible to set up accounts with multiple owners. In this case, each of the owners has to generate their own signer and provide their public keys to the deployer. Also, the signer used to deploy the account doesn't have to be among its owners. 6. Deploy the wallet account contract to blockchain Use the following command for a simple one-owner account: everdev contract deploy SetcodeMultisig.abi.json constructor --signer wallet_signer --input owners:[&lt;owner_public_key&gt;],reqConfirms:1,lifetime:3600 --value 1000000000  Where value parameter is the amount of nanotokens to be spent on deployment (can be omitted, in which case 10 tokens from giver will be spent) owner_public_key is usually the public key of wallet_signer in the form 0x.... lifetime - time in seconds that a transaction in multi-owner accounts will persits and be available for signing by other owners. For a simple multi owner account may be set to any value, as it will be executed immediately anyway. Example: everdev contract deploy SetcodeMultisig.abi.json constructor --signer wallet_signer --input owners:[0x8f8779e7c1944b133a423df96d06ae770c996f19d63438dbf2f569a29529b248],reqConfirms:1,lifetime:3600 --value 1000000000  For more complex cases (multiple owners etc.) view Everdev contract tool docs and guides. Once the contract is deployed, its address will be displayed in terminal. everdev contract deploy SetcodeMultisig.abi.json constructor --signer wallet_signer --input owners:[0x3da1909b7a4bd11fd9a1d79ca9713a9a8645880e0a7a12f9691c68e95d56fe75],reqConfirms:1,lifetime:3600 --value 10000000000 Configuration Network: dev (devnet.evercloud.dev) Signer: wallet_signer (public 8f8779e7c1944b133a423df96d06ae770c996f19d63438dbf2f569a29529b248) Address: 0:95c35b94e98c1b5c7716a9129ed5bb0798c8c336465fd8d1eb0d385e3d969494 (calculated from TVC and signer public) Parameters of constructor: owners (uint256[]): [&quot;0x3da1909b7a4bd11fd9a1d79ca9713a9a8645880e0a7a12f9691c68e95d56fe75&quot;] reqConfirms (uint8): &quot;1&quot; lifetime (uint32): &quot;3600&quot; Deploying...

(Optional) Multi-owner accounts and Confirm transaction Note, that if your user account has multiple custodians, the transaction has to be confirmed by the required number of signatures to be executed. This transaction ID should be communicated to other custodians, who should use it to confirm the transaction. To withdraw tokens from a multi-owner account use the following command: everdev contract run SetcodeMultisig.abi.json submitTransaction --address &lt;wallet_account_address&gt; --signer wallet_signer --input '{ &quot;dest&quot;: &quot;recipient_address&quot;, &quot;value&quot;:10000000000, &quot;bounce&quot;: false, &quot;allBalance&quot;: false, &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;stateInit&quot;: null }'  &lt;wallet_account_address&gt; - address of the user account. Example: 0:7bf2b2ec80371601f854bff9ed0a1171714d922c8bfc86d39e67a7e3a41b2176 wallet_signer - name of the user account owner signer value: - amount of tokens to transfer in nanotokens (Example: value:10000000000 sets up a transfer of 10 tokens). bounce - use false to transfer funds to an already deployed account allBalance - used to transfer all funds in the wallet. Use false for a simple transfer. payload - use &quot;&quot; for simple transfer. stateInit - use null for a simple transfer. This will generate a transaction and display its transId that will have to be confirmed by other custodians. To confirm a transaction, use the following command: everdev contract run SetcodeMultisig.abi.json confirmTransaction --address &lt;wallet_account_address&gt; --signer wallet_signer2 --input transactionId:6954030467099431873  &lt;wallet_account_address&gt; - address of the user account. Example: 0:7bf2b2ec80371601f854bff9ed0a1171714d922c8bfc86d39e67a7e3a41b2176 wallet_signer2 - signer of another multisig custodian (not the one who initiated the transaction). transactionId – the ID of the transaction can be acquired from the custodian who created it. Mitigating risks of token loss due to user error The are two main cases regarding transfers to user accounts: a user may already have an active account to which they want to withdraw funds (set bounce to true), or they may want to withdraw funds to a completely new account, that doesn't exist at the time withdraw is requested (set bounce to false). The status of the account provided by the user may be checked with the following Everdev command: everdev contract info --address external_address  Example of existing account: everdev contract info --address 0:665a62042aff317ba3f32e36b712b0f4a9d35277dd76dc38c9762cc6421681cf Configuration Network: dev (devnet.evercloud.dev) Signer: owner_keys (public 5ff6b5ba62b52b25ef347984912937bffaf2df88605e4e56cb64b9b617a28fea) Address: 0:665a62042aff317ba3f32e36b712b0f4a9d35277dd76dc38c9762cc6421681cf Account: Active Balance: ≈ 51655 tokens (51655086754193 nano)  Example of account that doesn't exist yet: everdev contract info --address 0:6238e23f6987883b3d1a86e1c39c63ae2baf7f93603d0ea5dc9b6e91ef54a1ab Configuration Network: dev (devnet.evercloud.dev) Signer: owner_keys (public 5ff6b5ba62b52b25ef347984912937bffaf2df88605e4e56cb64b9b617a28fea) Address: 0:6238e23f6987883b3d1a86e1c39c63ae2baf7f93603d0ea5dc9b6e91ef54a1ab (calculated from TVC and signer public) Code Hash: 80d6c47c4a25543c9b397b71716f3fae1e2c5d247174c52e2c19bd896442b105 (from TVC file) Account: Doesn't exist  The possible results of this command are the following: Doesn't exist - account does not exist. It needs to be sponsored, then deployed, and only then will it be active. Uninit - account already has some funds on it but contract code has not been deployed yet. User needs to deploy it. Active - account already exists, and its code is deployed. In the first to cases, the service might first transfer a small portion of the requested amount (~1 EVER) and request that the user deploys their contract. Upon the user's confirmation that the account is deployed, its status may be rechecked, and if it became active, the remaining amount of requested funds may be safely transferred. If the account is already active, a small portion of the requested amount may be transferred to the user, and the user may be asked what amount they received (note: a small amount of the transfer, usually less than 0.05 EVER, will be spent on fees, so it's best to ask for the whole number of tokens transferred). If the amounts match, the rest of the requested funds may be transferred as well.

A sample is available in this repository and an overview of the relevant part is given below. In this sample JS SDK is used. Bindings for a large number of languages have been developed for SDK. This example shows how to generate a withdrawal transaction from a Multisig wallet, using its sendTransaction method. Note, that if Multisig has multiple custodians, the transaction will have to be confirmed with the confirmTransaction method. In this example tokens are withdrawn from the user account to the account specified in dest. In a proper implementation, the account given by user should be used instead.  // We send 0.5 tokens. Value is written in nanotokens const amount = 0.5e9 const dest = &quot;-1:7777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777&quot; console.log('Sending 0.5 token to', dest) result = await client.processing.process_message({ message_encode_params: { address: msigAddress, ...messageParams, // use the same params as for `encode_message`, call_set: { // plus add `call_set` function_name: 'sendTransaction', input: { dest: dest, value: amount, bounce: true, flags: 64, payload: '' } }, }, send_events: false, // do not send intermidate events }) console.log('Transfer completed. Transaction hash', result.transaction?.id) assert.equal(result.transaction?.status, 3) assert.equal(result.transaction?.status_name, &quot;finalized&quot;)  Mitigating risks of token loss due to user error Similarly to the everdev approach, you can add the account status check prior to sending tokens. The are two main cases regarding transfers to user accounts: a user may already have an active account to which they want to withdraw funds, or they may want to withdraw funds to a completely new account, that doesn't exist at the time withdraw is requested. Here is an example of checking account status in SDK:  let balance: number let accType: number for (; ;) { // The idiomatic way to send a request is to specify // query and variables as separate properties. const getInfoQuery = ` query getBalance($address: String!) { blockchain { account(address: $address) { info { balance acc_type } } } } ` const resultOfQuery: ResultOfQuery = await client.net.query({ query: getInfoQuery, variables: { address: msigAddress } }) const nanotokens = parseInt(resultOfQuery.result.data.blockchain.account.info?.balance, 16) accType = resultOfQuery.result.data.blockchain.account.info?.acc_type; if (nanotokens &gt; MINIMAL_BALANCE * 1e9) { balance = nanotokens / 1e9 break } // TODO: rate limiting await sleep(1000) } console.log(`Account balance is: ${balance.toString(10)} tokens.

REMP adds some additional guarantees/features for external messages processing: 1. Replay protection If a message is processed and added into an accepted block, then the same message (that is, the message with the same hash) will not be collated for some time period. If the message has some expiration time (corresponding to the time period), then this effectively makes efficient replay protection. 2. No messages are lost You only need to send the message once. If there will be a possibility to accept it and add it to a block, then it will be done. Message loss may occur only for blockchain overloading reasons. 3. One can trace the message processing. There are several checkpoints on the message processing path (when validators received the message, when message was added to a block, when the block was finalized, etc). Upon reaching certain checkpoints one can predict that the message will be successfully processed with a high accuracy - most messages can be considered to be processed when validators acknowledge that they were received (this happens in 100-200 ms; after that it’s highly unlikely that the message is declined). Thus, depending on the message importance one may trade efficiency for reliability in the software, choosing not to trace further processing results. On the other hand, if a transaction is really important, then you can wait till the block with the transaction result is issued. During validation, as the message passes through various stages (that is, changes some statuses), validator sends receipts about each.

"},{"title":"Smart Conctracts, ABI and Messages","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/develop/sc-abi-messages","content":"Smart Conctracts, ABI and Messages Frontend developers used to build a UI around some machinery called “backend”, that can be accessed via an API. The common practice in software development is to have some schema definitions, usually built with tool called swagger. In blockchain development, the “backend” thing is called a smart contract. It is usually being built with Solidity language, and also has schema definition called an Abstract Binary Interface, or ABI. In most cases, a frontend developer doesn’t need to bother his mind with understanding the smart-contract code. But it is crucial to understand the ABI to interact with a smart contract. Let’s see how an ABI looks like, and what can we underfstand from it without reading the smart contract itself. ABI { // Major version of ABI standart &quot;ABI version&quot;: 2, // Full version of ABI // Can be – 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 version: &quot;2.3&quot;, // Headers, specifying SDK which additional fields to attach to external message // Defined in the contract code, there are: // pragma AbiHeader time; // pragma AbiHeader pubkey; // pragma AbiHeader expire; header: [ &quot;time&quot;, &quot;pubkey&quot;, &quot;expire&quot; ], // Description of callable function signatures // both internal and external messages functions: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;constructor&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;: [], &quot;outputs&quot;: [] }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;get&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;: [], &quot;outputs&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;value0&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;}] }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;getInternal&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;: [ {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;answerId&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint32&quot;} ], &quot;outputs&quot;: [ {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;value0&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;} ] }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;set&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;_value&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;}], &quot;outputs&quot;: [] } ], // A description of the events that a contract can create events: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VariableChanged&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;new_value&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;}], &quot;outputs&quot;: [] } ], // A list of static variables that must be specified to deploy the contract data: [ {&quot;key&quot;:1,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;owner&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;address&quot;} // There are also three hidden variables that SDK will set by itself // _pubkey, _timestamp, _constructorFlag ], // a list of all variables, so that you can // download the contract state and decode it fields: [ {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;_pubkey&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;}, // tvm.pubkey() {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;_timestamp&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint64&quot;}, // set by SDK {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;_constructorFlag&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;bool&quot;}, // set by SDK {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;owner&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;address&quot;}, {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;variable&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;} ] } An ABI describes how we pack the data into a TOC (Tree Of Cells) - the fundamental internal data structure of Everscale blockchain. We need that to encode the message according to Everscale standard and send it to the blockchain. Any message have a body for the function call. Let's look at an example function from abi: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;set&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;_value&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;}], &quot;outputs&quot;: [] } In the Recipes section, we provide snippets for ever-sdk-js, surf-keeper-provider and everscale-inpage-provider libraries, where we use ABI to interact with smart-contracts. It’s important to understand what happens under the hood, so lets summarize: we want to encode the payload, construct the message to some contract and send it over the RPC to a blockhain. Usually you will connect your dApp to existing smart contract system, deployed on-chain by a smart-contract developer. We assume that you have an ABI an address of one or several contracts.

For this we need an Everscale development environment. If you don't have it installed yet, please follow this link. In case you do, please proceed with locklift init. npx locklift init --path my-first-crowdsale Now, we need TIP-3 sources. Let’s add them. package.json { &quot;devDependencies&quot;: { &quot;tip3&quot;: &quot;git://github.com/broxus/tip3#v5&quot;, ... }, } locklift.config.ts compiler: { ... externalContracts: { &quot;node_modules/tip3/build&quot;: [&quot;TokenRoot&quot;, &quot;TokenWallet&quot;], }, } Well done! Now it's the time to proceed with our tokensale contract. Create a Tokensale.sol file in your contracts folder. Let's firstly arrange pragmas and imports. Tokensale.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; pragma AbiHeader pubkey; import &quot;tip3/contracts/interfaces/IAcceptTokensTransferCallback.sol&quot;; import &quot;tip3/contracts/interfaces/ITokenRoot.sol&quot;; import &quot;tip3/contracts/interfaces/ITokenWallet.sol&quot;; We will use some interfaces from the TIP-3 implementation. Let's define our contract state and constructor. Tokensale.sol contract Tokensale { uint16 static _nonce; // Some random value to affect on contract address address static _owner; // Tokensale owner. Will receive all transfers address public _distributedTokenRoot; // TIP3 TokenRoot address for deploying wallet for Tokensale. This token will be distributed address public _distributedTokenWallet; // TIP3 wallet for Tokensale for sending purchased tokens uint256 public _supply; // How much tokens will be distributed (with decimals) uint128 public _rate; // How much tokens buyer will receive for 1 nanoever (1*10^9) constructor( address distributedTokenRoot, uint256 supply, uint128 rate, address sendRemainingGasTo ) public { tvm.accept(); // This action is required to process external messages that bring no value - deploy as we have. tvm.rawReserve(1 ever, 0); // we will always reserve 1 ever on this contract _distributedTokenRoot = distributedTokenRoot; _rate = rate; _supply = supply; // fundamental mechanic of dapps working with tip3 - deploy it's own wallet to operate with. check tip3 specs for more info ITokenRoot(distributedTokenRoot).deployWallet { value: 0.2 ever, flag: 1, callback: Tokensale.onTokenWallet // this callback will be called by TokenRoot after deploying wallet for tokensale } ( address(this), 0.1 ever ); // sending remaining gas after setups sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } } Let's delve a bit into some mechanics of this piece of code. The first thing that you should look at is gas management. Look at these two lines: tvm.rawReserve(1 ever, 0); sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); The first line reserves 1 EVER in this contract. Practically, it generates an outbound message carrying reserve nanoevers to oneself so that the next actions performed would not be able to spend more evers than the remainder. The second line is a best practice for gas management in Everscale. You should always send the remaining gas to the message sender or another given address. Pay attention to value and flag parameters of transfer function. Flag 128 means that this transfer will carry all remaining non-reserved gas! To sum up, we have the following flow: Reserving some initial contract balance for an always active state. Perform contract logic (may be checking inbound value in case needed). Send remaining gas with 128 flag to the message sender or another pointed address. The next important logic of our constructor code is deploying a wallet for the contract on-chain. Tokensale.sol ... ITokenRoot(distributedTokenRoot).deployWallet { value: 0.2 ever, flag: 1, callback: Tokensale.onTokenWallet // this callback will be called by TokenRoot after deploying wallet for tokensale } ( address(this), 0.1 ever ); ... This action generates an outbound message to TokenRoot contract by calling a deployWallet function. This function is responsible. It means that it will generate an internal outbound message by calling a function that was passed in a callback parameter (onTokenWallet in our case). Let's implement this function for our Tokensale contract. From TIP-3 source code we know that deployWallet returns only one parameter - deployed wallet address. So, just store it in our state. Tokensale.sol ... function onTokenWallet(address value) external { require ( msg.sender.value != 0 &amp;&amp; msg.sender == _distributedTokenRoot, // check, that calling was from TokenRoot we need 101 // some error code for this require ); tvm.rawReserve(1 ever, 0); _distributedTokenWallet = value; // store deployed tip3 wallet address _owner.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); // sending remaining gas after setups } ... That's all. When we deploy the Tokensale contract, deployWallet will be called too and the returned value will be stored in our contract state. All we need is a function to sell our tokens. Tokensale.sol ... function buyTokens(uint128 deposit) external view { tvm.rawReserve(1 ever, 0); // 1 ever is a technical value for fee...remaining gas will be returned after tokens transfer (from tip3 wallet) if (deposit &gt; msg.value + 1 ever) { // if we using require, we are frozing incoming value in this contract, so just return it msg.sender.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } else { uint128 purchase = _rate * deposit; if (purchase &gt; _supply) { msg.sender.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false}); } else { TvmCell empty; // here we just operate with deployed in constructor wallet. owner should provide token supply on this wallet before sales! ITokenWallet(_distributedTokenWallet).transfer{ value: 0, flag: 128 }( purchase, msg.sender, 0.1 ever, // this parameter allows to deploy wallet for user, if it's not deployed yet. (fee takes from message so will be payed by user) msg.sender, false, empty ); } } } ... Notice that we don't use require instruction to check incoming value. If we use require, the user's deposit will not be returned to the sender and will stay in the contract. So anyone can take this as a remaining gas, according to gas management (because these evers won't be reserved). Best practice - when you check something incoming (evers, other TIP-3 tokens), you should use if instead of require. The next mechanic is already familiar to you. Tokensale just calls its own deployed in the constructor wallet to transfer tokens for a buyer. Of course, you should transfer supply tokens to the tokensale wallet before the sale starts :) ITokenWallet(_distributedTokenWallet).transfer{ value: 0, flag: 128 }( purchase, msg.sender, 0.1 ever, // this parameter allows to deploy wallet for user, if it's not deployed yet. (fee takes from message so will be payed by user) msg.sender, false, empty ); Pay attention to value and flag. Again 0 and 128. This allows us to delegate sending of the remaining gas to the TokenWallet contract (of course if you are sure, that delegate performs this action). We send all remaining non-reserved gas to TokenWallet, and, after its own actions, TokenWallet will return the remaining gas where required. (4th parameter of transfer function). So, let's check our final contract code Tokensale.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; pragma AbiHeader pubkey; import &quot;tip3/contracts/interfaces/IAcceptTokensTransferCallback.sol&quot;; import &quot;tip3/contracts/interfaces/ITokenRoot.sol&quot;; import &quot;tip3/contracts/interfaces/ITokenWallet.sol&quot;; contract Tokensale { uint16 static _nonce; // some random value to affect on contract address address static _owner; // tokensale owner. will receive all transfers address public _distributedTokenRoot; // TIP3 TokenRoot address for deploying wallet for Tokensale.

ITokenWallet(_distributedTokenWallet).transfer{ value: 0, flag: 128 }( purchase, msg.sender, 0.1 ever, // this parameter allows to deploy wallet for user, if it's not deployed yet. (fee takes from message so will be payed by user) msg.sender, false, empty ); } } } } All you need now is to write some tests with locklift support.

Everscale is no exception to this widespread practice. Let us move directly to an example of how such a system works in practice. We will use a similar TIP-3 mechanic: having a root contract (Vote) and personal Wallets (Ballots). Every participant deploys a ballot for itself that has a vote function, which will call the callback of the Vote contract and pass the vote result into. Nevertheless, what if we want to provide voting rights only for some specific users? In this case, we will have to add an activate function in our Ballot contract, that will be called externally and only by our vote creator (external calls may be signed). No further ado. Let's start with familiar command npx locklift init --path my-smv As mentioned, we need to implement two smart contracts. There are no external dependencies for this guide. Start with the Vote contract. Vote.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; pragma AbiHeader pubkey; import &quot;./Ballot.sol&quot;; contract Vote { uint16 static _nonce; TvmCell static _ballotCode; uint256 _managerPublicKey; uint32 _acceptedCount; uint32 _rejectedCount; constructor( uint256 managerPublicKey, address sendRemainingGasTo ) public { tvm.accept(); tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); _managerPublicKey = managerPublicKey; sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } } Next function we need - deployBallot. It realizes the popular &quot;deploy contract from contract&quot; mechanic well-described here. We should just use tvm.buildStateInit function, fill varInit section with future values of our Ballot contract static variables and use the keyword new for deploying. Vote.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; ... contract Vote { ... function deployBallot(address owner, address sendRemainingGasTo) external view { tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); TvmCell ballotStateInit = tvm.buildStateInit({ contr: Ballot, // varInit section has an affect for target contract address calculation varInit: { _vote: address(this), _managerPublicKey: _managerPublicKey, _owner: owner }, code: _ballotCode // we store it in state }); new Ballot{ stateInit: ballotStateInit, value: 0, flag: 128 }( sendRemainingGasTo ); } ... } Well, the votes will be stored in our Vote contract. That's why we need a special function, that can be called only by Ballot contract. Ballot contract will call this function and pass a vote (accept or reject). But how we can define a function, that can be called only by contracts with concrete code (by contracts, that were deployed by Vote contract)? It can't be any easier. The address of any contract can be definitely calculated if you know state init variables, a public key and contract code: Vote.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; ... contract Vote { ... // this function will be called by ballots, but how we can know - is calling ballot a fake or not? function onBallotUsed(address owner, address sendRemainingGasTo, bool accept) external { tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); // if you know init params of contract you can pretty simple calculate it's address TvmCell ballotStateInit = tvm.buildStateInit({ contr: Ballot, varInit: { _vote: address(this), _managerPublicKey: _managerPublicKey, _owner: owner }, code: _ballotCode }); // so address is a hash from state init address expectedAddress = address(tvm.hash(ballotStateInit)); // and now we can just compare msg.sender address with calculated expected address // if its equals - calling ballot has the same code, that Vote stores and deploys if (msg.sender == expectedAddress) { if (accept) { _acceptedCount++; } else { _rejectedCount++; } sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false}); } else { msg.sender.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } } ... } That is the way out! TokenWallets of TIP-3 implementation work the same way to transfer tokens (one wallet calls another wallet's acceptTransfer function). The last thing we need is a getDetails view function to return the results of our vote function getDetails() external view returns (uint32 accepted, uint32 rejected) { return (_acceptedCount, _rejectedCount); } Bring it all together Vote.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; pragma AbiHeader pubkey; import &quot;./Ballot.sol&quot;; contract Vote { uint16 static _nonce; TvmCell static _ballotCode; uint256 _managerPublicKey; uint32 _acceptedCount; uint32 _rejectedCount; constructor( uint256 managerPublicKey, address sendRemainingGasTo ) public { tvm.accept(); tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); _managerPublicKey = managerPublicKey; sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } function deployBallot(address owner, address sendRemainingGasTo) external view { tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); TvmCell ballotStateInit = tvm.buildStateInit({ contr: Ballot, varInit: { _vote: address(this), _managerPublicKey: _managerPublicKey, _owner: owner }, code: _ballotCode }); new Ballot{ stateInit: ballotStateInit, value: 0, flag: 128 }( sendRemainingGasTo ); } // this function will be called by ballots, but how we can know - is calling ballot a fake or not? function onBallotUsed(address owner, address sendRemainingGasTo, bool accept) external { tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); // if you know init params of contract you can pretty simple calculate it's address TvmCell ballotStateInit = tvm.buildStateInit({ contr: Ballot, varInit: { _vote: address(this), _managerPublicKey: _managerPublicKey, _owner: owner }, code: _ballotCode }); // so address is a hash from state init address expectedAddress = address(tvm.hash(ballotStateInit)); // and now we can just compare msg.sender address with calculated expected address // if its equals - calling ballot has the same code, that Vote stores and deploys if (msg.sender == expectedAddress) { if (accept) { _acceptedCount++; } else { _rejectedCount++; } sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false}); } else { msg.sender.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } } function getDetails() external view returns (uint32 accepted, uint32 rejected) { return (_acceptedCount, _rejectedCount); } } Now let's deal with Ballot contract. There is no something special in state and constructor: Ballot.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; pragma AbiHeader pubkey; import &quot;./interfaces/IVote.sol&quot;; contract Ballot { address static _vote; uint256 static _managerPublicKey; // we have a static for owner...so our logic would be like &quot;allow this address to vote&quot; // we can store a static here for ballot number, and our logic would been &quot;allow that ballot to vote&quot; address static _owner; bool _activated; // have ballot already been activated bool _used; // have ballot already been used (vote) constructor(address sendRemainingGasTo) public { // we are reserving another 0.1 here for paying for future external call // all another reserves will be on 0.1 only tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever + 0.1 ever, 0); if (msg.sender != _vote) { selfdestruct(msg.sender); } _activated = false; _used = false; } } Let's talk about the activation mechanic. In constructor, we already reserved little more EVERs. We made it with the purpose, that fee for the external call will be paid from the contract balance. That way of gas management allows us to transfer external calls fee-paying to user responsibility. But activate method shouldn't be called by somebody unauthorized, so we just use require keyword by comparing msg.pubkey and _managerPublicKey stored in state init. Of course, you need to call tvm.accept() function. Simply put, this call allows the contract to use its own balance for executive pay. Ballot.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; ... import &quot;./interfaces/IVote.sol&quot;; contract Ballot { ... // this function will be called by external message, so contract will pay for this call // this mechanic exists for moving commision paying to user responsibility // in consctructor we reserver a little more EVERs, so here we just will use them (with returning remains) // useful mechaninc for your dapp function activate() external { require(msg.pubkey() == _managerPublicKey, 200); tvm.accept(); // allow to use contract balance for paying this function execution _activated = true; tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); _owner.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } ... } Let's implement the main function of our Ballot - vote. Pay attention to imports. We have import &quot;./interfaces/IVote.sol&quot;. It's just an interface for calling our Vote contract (just like for EVM if you know what I mean). interfaces/IVote.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; interface IVote { function onBallotUsed(address owner, address sendRemainingGasTo, bool accept) external; } Let us now return to vote function Ballot.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; ... import &quot;./interfaces/IVote.sol&quot;; contract Ballot { ... function vote(address sendRemainingGasTo, bool accept) external { require(msg.sender == _owner, 201); // remember the library for error codes :) require(_activated &amp;&amp; !_used, 202); tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); // just call our vote contract IVote(_vote).onBallotUsed{ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: true }(_owner, sendRemainingGasTo, accept); _used = true; } ... } That's all. Vote contract will check our Ballot address by calculating it, as you remember, and the vote will be accepted. But what if Vote calls will fail because of some reason (low gas attached or yet network problem!)? Our Ballot will be marked as used (_used state variable will be set as true, and we can't call vote once again). To solve this problems, TVM has bounce messages and onBounce function for handling them. Let's deal with it by example Ballot.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; ... import &quot;./interfaces/IVote.sol&quot;; contract Ballot { ... // onBounce function! // if our vote contract will reject message, it sends a bounce message to this callback. We should return _used flag to false! onBounce(TvmSlice bounce) external { uint32 functionId = bounce.decode(uint32); // IVote.onBallotUsed send us a bounce message if (functionId == tvm.functionId(IVote.onBallotUsed) &amp;&amp; msg.sender == _vote) { tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); _used = false; // reset _used flag to false } } ... } That's it. Now let's bring it all together. Ballot.sol pragma ever-solidity &gt;= 0.61.2; pragma AbiHeader expire; pragma AbiHeader pubkey; import &quot;./interfaces/IVote.sol&quot;; contract Ballot { address static _vote; uint256 static _managerPublicKey; // we have a static for owner...so our logic would be like &quot;allow this address to vote&quot; // we can store a static here for ballot number, and our logic would been &quot;allow that ballot to vote&quot; address static _owner; bool _activated; // have ballot already been activated bool _used; // have ballot already been used (vote) constructor(address sendRemainingGasTo) public { // we are reserving another 0.1 here for paying for future external call // all another reserves will be on 0.1 only tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever + 0.1 ever, 0); if (msg.sender != _vote) { selfdestruct(msg.sender); } _activated = false; _used = false; sendRemainingGasTo.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } // this function will be called by external message, so contract will pay for this call // this mechanic exists for moving commision paying to user responsibility // in consctructor we reserver a little more EVERs, so here we just will use them (with returning remains) // useful mechaninc for your dapp function activate() external { require(msg.pubkey() == _managerPublicKey, 200); tvm.accept(); // allow to use contract balance for paying this function execution _activated = true; tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); _owner.transfer({ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: false }); } function vote(address sendRemainingGasTo, bool accept) external { require(msg.sender == _owner, 201); require(_activated &amp;&amp; !_used, 202); tvm.rawReserve(0.1 ever, 0); // just call our vote contract IVote(_vote).onBallotUsed{ value: 0, flag: 128, bounce: true }(_owner, sendRemainingGasTo, accept); _used = true; } // onBounce function! // if our vote contract will reject message, it sends a bounce message to this callback.

The Everscale network is split into data shards called workchains. Each election cycle, the global set of validators rotate and are assigned to a workchain. Validators store data and process transactions only for their assigned workchain. As long as validators download blocks of other workchains and update their state based on the changes that occurred, all workchains can run in conjunction. As of now, Everscale is comprised of two global shards: the masterchain and the main workchain. Everscale’s architecture can potentially accommodate up to 232 workchains. Each newly created workchain can have its own configuration parameters, virtual machine and native currency,  The masterchain is for the synchronization of messages and transaction execution. That is to say, for a multi-chain network to securely operate, the nodes need to reach consensus. On Everscale, all workchain block proofs are posted to the masterchain. The blocks of the masterchain contain the latest block hashes of all other chains in the network. The main workchain, on the other hand, consists of smart contracts and is used for transactions. Each workchain, on its part, is split into execution shards called threads. Threads contain a chunk of the network’s total number of smart contracts. Validators rotate through the assigned threads and process the transactions only in their thread. The number of threads varies from 1 to 256, depending on the network activity. Such a multithreading approach allows for parallel execution of smart contracts by subgroups of validators that share the same data.  The need to resort to such a technical solution was dictated by several constraints. Namely, the first one arises when there is a need to send a lot of messages between servers. At a certain point, the internet connection could run out. Although data sharding solves this issue, it leaves the second problem, the lack of processing power. For this reason, multithreading, in the form of parallel execution, is fundamental for network scalability.

It envisaged cross-shared transactions and hundreds of shards. Later, the number of shards was reduced to 32, and now the idea was completely abandoned (at least for the near future). Instead, the decision was made in favor of rollups. The arguments explaining why rollups are not the right solution due to their centralisation and low security are a topic for a separate article. Generally speaking, they are no more than different networks that rely on some security measures from L1. They are also extremely inconvenient for the end users. It is very difficult to implement normal sharding in the Ethereum network due to its inherent synchronous architecture. Aslo, it is troublesome to make synchronous cross-chain transactions, and absolutely impossible to make it so that there is a large throughput. And if each shard exists independently, then this is not much better than rollups are. In Everscale, the asynchronous architecture was designed from scratch. All contracts communicate with each other via messages. Therefore, the only thing needed for sharding to work is the synchronization of message queues between shards. At the same time, since Everscale was developed by blockchain maximalists, they went even further. That is to say, they developed not just a form of classical sharding, but infinite sharding. "},{"title":"Modus operandi​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Differences from EVM","url":"/overview/differences-from-evm#modus-operandi","content":"Currently, Everscale is comprised of two global shards called workchains: Master-workchain (masterchain) for synchronization and governance, and the main workchain for smart contracts. The main workchain can be partitioned into N shards (from 1 to 256 shards). Each shard has its own group of validators. This sub-group is responsible for executing transactions in its own shard. At the same time, it constantly downloads blocks from all other shards of its workchain. A block in Everscale is not just a list of transactions that need to be completed in order to achieve changes in the state. Instead, a block is: A list of messages for which transactions were executed, removing them from the incoming queue.New messages that entered the outgoing queue after message processing.Changes in smart contract states that resulted from message processing. That is, in order for the validator from shard X to maintain the current state of shard Y, it does not need to execute all the transactions that were in the block of shard Y. It simply downloads the block and rolls up the changes that have occurred in the message queue and smart contract states. "},{"title":"Sharding in Everscale is not merely data sharding, but computational resources sharding​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Differences from EVM","url":"/overview/differences-from-evm#sharding-in-everscale-is-not-merely-data-sharding-but-computational-resources-sharding","content":"In case there are too many transactions in the last N block of some particular shard, then the shard is simply divided into two. This is done in accordance with the address range of smart contracts, with some transactions going to one shard while the rest to the other. The resulting shards, in turn, can also be divided into two more. In order for this to work, Everscale also decided to abandon the idea of radical decentralization. The number of validators in the network will be in the number of thousands, not hundreds of thousands like on Ethereum network. Everscale validators are professional players with big stakes and expensive servers. Currently, the validator requirements are: 48 CPUs, 128 RAM and 1TB SDD + 1 GB network bandwidth. Having such sharding capabilities, Everscale achieves a huge network throughput. Importantly, this is accomplished without any damages to customer satisfaction. That is to say, the customer does not have to switch between shards himself, or constantly transfer tokens from one rollup to another. It is important to mention that there is also a big security issue arising. As the number of shards increases, there are fewer instruments to watch over each one of them. Therefore, in the event of a high block mining rate, it may lead to the collusion of the validators of a single shard. This, in turn, could end with someone creating the original message that carries the money not belonging to the originator of the contract. A new consensus mechanism (SMFT) that is currently under development solves this issue. Basically, it takes advantage of the current architecture of Everscale where validators share computation among themselves. This way, all validators always have the data of all shards. It means that each newly issued block can be validated independently. Let’s see how it actually works. Please note that the text below describes the principle of work, not the exact algorithm. Each validator comes up with a random number and sends its hash to other validators.After all shards have created a block, but before the rest of the shards accept it, all validators must take the hash of this block, mix it with a random number, and if the remainder of dividing the resulting number by N is zero, then the validator must check this block, and send validators of -1 governance shard-chain a “yes” or “no”.If there is at least one ‘’no’’, then the verification of this block by the rest of the validators starts. In the case of an invalid block, not only the validators who created this block will be terminated, but also those who said “yes” or remained silent.Before creating the next block, everyone reveals their guessed number and guesses a new one.Thus, shard validators never know which and how many other validators will validate their block. It is a very nice and elegant solution. "},{"title":"Large amount of data and its long tail issue​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Differences from EVM","url":"/overview/differences-from-evm#large-amount-of-data-and-its-long-tail-issue","content":"The original idea of blockchain was that there is a chain of blocks from the very beginning (genesis) to the latest block. And there is always the possibility to synchronize from the genesis block to the latest one, to check that everything runs well. However, already for a long time on Ethereum, full-nodes begin to synchronize with some kind of snapshot from the recent past, and not from the genesis block. Many Ethereum maximalists are still not ready to accept the idea that storing the entire history of blocks is wrong. They believe that history should be stored forever. It entails that there is a need for special protocols to allow users to always check some particular piece of information from history. However, it can be argued that even the Ethereum dev team has abandoned this idea. In the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, there is the section called “History expiry” stating that full-nodes should not store the history of blocks for more than a year. The history of blocks is critically important for rollups. That is, if a rollup operator terminates its operation, then you need the entire history of its transactions in order to withdraw your money from it, on L1. This is one of the reasons why rollups are a questionable solution. Starting with Eth 2.0, we can only say that the history of blocks is probably stored at least somewhere. It is assumed that the history will be stored by blockchain explorers. The Ethereum devs team are also thinking about some new techniques for storing history. So far there are none. There is also an understanding that we can only choose from one of the following two options: high throughput or storage history. To add, there is also a concept called &quot;Log events&quot;. It was created to simplify the development of Web3 solutions. However, due to the fact that full-nodes or blockchain providers (infura) are as well required to store an infinitely increasing amount of information, the requests to them are very slow. This, too, has already been de facto recognized as a mistake. However, due to the large number of dApps already delivered by Ethereum, it will be difficult for them to refuse this concept. But that's only half the problem. There is also the issue of blockchain state growth. If someone recorded something on the blockchain, at least once, for example, buying a memcoin for 0.001. Then, even if the price of the memcoin goes to zero, the validators will still be required to store the information about your purchase forever. That is, you pay for the record once, but it will be stored forever. And here comes the interesting economics - blockchains are forced to limit the rate of recording transactions artificially so that the size of the blockchain state does not grow faster than data storage becomes cheaper. As a result, users are forced to compete with each other for the right to record data on the blockchain via an auction. Subsequently, it makes the transaction fees increase all the time. This issue has also been de facto acknowledged by the Ethereum team, so that they introduced &quot;State expiry” in the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap. But of course they can't completely solve this problem without breaking backwards compatibility. So far, it is proposed to remove contracts from the state that have not been accessed for N years (for example, 10), with the possibility of recovery. Some other blockchains also explore ways to solve this issue. For example, in Near blockchain, the smart contract must lock N tokens each time it registers new information in the state. The issuer of the smart contract can set the conditions on it, so that the user can delete his information and receive the tokens back. This is definitely only a half-measure. Not all issuers of smart contracts set this condition, and even those who do, do not think about the mechanism of how to return tokens in case the cost of transactions changes in the future. Other blockchains simply remove smart contracts with fewer N tokens on the balance from the state. Everscale never looks for easy and uncostly ways to solve blockchain issues. Therefore, the highlighted problem was resolved with the maximum efficiency and accuracy possible. In the Everscale blockchain, each contract is required to pay rent for storing its data in the state. This rent corresponds to the size of the data. When the money runs out, the contract is deleted with the possibility of recovery, and then deleted completely. Thanks to this, Everscale achieves absolutely controlled behavior, when each smart contract decides for itself how long it will exist. Users do not have to compete with each other for the right to record data, and we get a huge throughput in terms of the number of transactions processed per second. Some other aspects distinguishing Everscale from Ethereum On Everscale, in contrast to Ethereum: Calls between contracts are asynchronous and not atomicContracts cannot run getter methods on other contractsContract code is not immutable and can be updatedThe gas price is constant.

In terms of DeBot, all these features are implemented without DInterfaces but in a native way, like two smart contracts communicating with each other — by sending messages directly to target address. But with only one difference — to call a get-method or call a function onchain DeBot must generate external inbound message, while to invoke another DeBot, it should generate an internal message to the invoked DeBot address. DEngine distinguishes between get-methods and onchain calls by examining the sign header of the message.

At the same time, to achieve sufficient decentralization, these servers have to belong to as many owners as possible. There seems to be a contradiction between these goals. In Proof-of-Work networks, performance is often sacrificed for decentralization. Yet, claims arise that the centralization of Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. mining power is not entirely prevented. Mining Pools centralization remains an issue, as these pools are controlled by particular entities distributing rewards. For example, almost 60% of Bitcoin mining power is concentrated in just 4 pools and around 80% of all mining power originates in China. Just 2 mining pools control 52% of Ethereum hashrate, more than 50% of which originates in China. In Proof-of-Stake, the correlation between network performance and concentration of power (money in this case) is even more apparent, as one does not need to buy, set up, and manage complicated mining farms. It can ultimately be claimed that POS is trading performance for decentralization (look no further than EOS centralization, Steemit network overtaking etc.).

On the other hand, blockchain users with no validating system might be interested in investing in validation duty. This is where the Decentralized Pool (DePool) smart contract comes in. There are two main use cases of DePool: User has no Validator capabilities but some free funds. User can support a third-party Validator and receive rewards.User has Validator capabilities and but doesn't have necessary amount of funds to participate in validator elections and subsequent rewards. "},{"title":"Basic terms​","type":1,"pageTitle":"dePool specification","url":"/spec/depool-specification#basic-terms","content":"DePool — a smart contract that allows other smart contracts to invest stakes into a common pool of funds and after some period of time to receive it back with interest.Elector — a system level smart contract, deployed to masterchain from zero state.

"},{"title":"Architecture​","type":1,"pageTitle":"dePool specification","url":"/spec/depool-specification#architecture","content":" DePool is designed to receive investment stakes from Participants, allocate the pool funds to a validator in order to participate in elections of the GVS and, after the end of the validation cycle, distribute stakes with certain rewards back to the Participants.DePool is deployed to basechain. But it cannot communicate with Elector directly, because Elector rejects messages from non-masterchain contracts. Thus there are DePool proxies that are deployed to masterchain and deliver messages from DePool to Elector and back. This is done, because DePool is a large and complex contract, and gas and storage fees are 10 times lower in basechain compared to masterchain. Keeping DePool on masterchain would be unreasonably expensive.DePool is open for Participants’ stakes at all times, however, there is a deadline for participation in the upcoming elections. The deadline depends on the timer of the Elector. After the deadline, the incoming stakes will be accumulated for participation in the next elections.DePool distinguishes stakes received before the deadline and after the deadline, therefore it stores information on Participant stakes in separate investment rounds (or rounds), one for every elections, to facilitate subsequent distribution of stakes and rewards. To separate Elector communication, DePool uses 2 proxies: one for even rounds, one for odd.In order to be time-aware, the DePool should be called from time to time. For this purpose the Timer contract is used. DePool Helper asks Timer to call it periodically and transmits every call from Timer to DePool. Interval between calls is chosen according to the elections interval.DePool must be linked to a validator wallet to participate in elections on behalf of the latter. This validator wallet address is specified during DePool deployment and cannot be changed afterwards. When elections start, DePool waits for signed election requests from linked wallet, then attaches round stake to request and transmits it to Elector.Validator can validate many DePools with 1 Validator wallet. Reputation of Validator wallet therefore is available and can be analyzed over time.To ensure that the validator will perform its functions correctly (be always online and not &quot;lie&quot; to other validators), the validator wallet must itself become a Participant and invest in every investment round at least m_validatorAssurance, which is initialized in DePool constructor. This can be achieved with any of the three available types of stakes.When Elector unfreezes validator stakes, DePool returns its stake back with round rewards. Part of the total reward is used to top up the DePool's own balance to a certain value. The rest is distributed as follows: m_validatorRewardFraction% goes to Validator wallet balance. m_participantRewardFraction% is distributed among all Participants in investment round (validator is also participant). m_associationRewardFraction% (can be equal to zero) goes to m_association address.DePool keeps a balance for each Participant and can automatically reinvest Participant's stake into the next investment round if appropriate flag is enabled.Participant can transfer part of its total stake to another Participant's stake inside DePool storage. This function allows for collateralization of the stake to provide liquidity to stake holders. "},{"title":"Special kinds of stakes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"dePool specification","url":"/spec/depool-specification#special-kinds-of-stakes","content":"Along with the basic ordinary stake, that functions according to the rules detailed above, there are 2 types of special stakes: vesting and lock stake. While the entire ordinary stake is invested into the current pooling round (and will thus be reinvested every second round), lock and vesting stakes are split into two equal parts upon reception, which are invested into the current pooling round, and the next round. This way they can be continuously reinvested into both odd and even rounds. "},{"title":"Vesting Stake​","type":1,"pageTitle":"dePool specification","url":"/spec/depool-specification#vesting-stake","content":"Any address can make a vesting stake and define a target participant address (beneficiary) who will own this stake. But not the whole stake is available to the beneficiary at once. Instead it is split into logical parts and the next part of stake becomes available to the participant only when next vesting period is ended. At completion step of every round DePool decides how many vesting parts should be unlocked and subtracted from vesting stake and become available to owner since last unlocking. These funds are added to beneficiary's ordinary stake. Example: address A makes a vesting stake of 120 tons for 1 year with vesting period of 1 month and defines address B as the stake beneficiary. It means that after 1 month 10 tons become available to address B and 110 tons are still locked in the pool. After 1 year vesting stake will be equal to 0 and last 10 tons will become available to owner. Vesting for validator beneficiaries is subject to additional rules: At the end of every withdrawal period, the part of the vesting stake to be released is divided proportionally into 2 parts — for rounds in this period when DePool successfully completed validation and received a reward (without slashing) and for rounds when DePool missed elections or was slashed. The portion of the stake corresponding to the successful rounds is sent to the validator, while the portion corresponding to the failed rounds is returned to the vesting stake owner. For example, if there were 100 rounds within the withdrawal period, and DePool successfully completed 80 of them, missed elections in 5 more and was slashed in the remaining 15, the validator will receive 80% of the unlocked part of the vesting stake, and the stake owner will get back 20% of it. "},{"title":"Lock Stake​","type":1,"pageTitle":"dePool specification","url":"/spec/depool-specification#lock-stake","content":"Any address can make a lock stake, in which it locks its funds in DePool for a defined period, but rewards from this stake will be payed to another target participant (beneficiary). At the end of a period the Lock Stake should be returned to the address which locked it. Example: address A makes a lock stake of 120 tons for 1 year with vesting period of 1 month and defines address B as the stake beneficiary. It means that after 1 month 10 tons become available to address A (as opposed to vesting, where these 10 tons would become available to address B, the beneficiary) and 110 tons are still locked in round. DePool will reinvest the gradually diminishing lock stake for a 1 year and pay rewards to B address. After 1 year DePool will return the remainder of the lock stake to address A. One Participant can be a beneficiary only of one lock and one vesting stake. Once current lock or vesting stake of the participant expires, it can be repeated.

Functions used by participants perform checks and send receiveAnswer message back to the caller with an error code and a comment in case of failure. If all conditions are met, DePool sends a confirmation message (receiveAnswer with status 0) back to the caller. All functions can be called by internal messages only. addOrdinaryStake(uint64 stake) — allows to make an ordinary stake in the current pooling round. The source address of the message is taken as Participant's address. The Participant's total stake is increased by stake amount. Parameters: stake — value of participant's stake in nanotons. Function checks that: inbound message value is at least (stake + ADD_STAKE_FEE);stake is at least min stake;pool is not closed. Function returns change (part of unused ADD_STAKE_FEE). addVestingStake(uint64 stake, address beneficiary, uint32 withdrawalPeriod, uint32 totalPeriod) — allows to add a vesting stake for another participant (beneficiary). The source address of the message is saved as the vesting stake owner. Parameters: stake — value of participant's stake in nanotons (Note: this value is divided into 2 parts and is added to 2 rounds).beneficiary — address of target participant (beneficiary);withdrawalPeriod — the period in seconds after which the part of the vesting becomes available for beneficiary;totalPeriod — total period of vesting in seconds after which beneficiary becomes owner of the whole stake. Function checks that: DePool is not closed (m_poolClosed ≠ true);beneficiary is an addr_std. It's not zero address. It's not the message sender (not self vesting);inbound msg.value ≥ (m_minStake + ADD_STAKE_FEE);Message value is at least stake + STAKE_FEE;stake / 2 is at least min stake;withdrawalPeriod ≤ totalPeriod;totalPeriod &lt; 18 years;withdrawalPeriod ≠ 0;totalPeriod % withdrawalPeriod = 0;beneficiary doesn't have a vesting stake. addLockStake(uint64 stake, address beneficiary, uint32 withdrawalPeriod, uint32 totalPeriod) — allows to add a stake that will bring rewards to another participant (beneficiary). The source address of the message is saved as the lock stake owner. It has the same parameters and checks as addVestingStake, but it checks that participant doesn't have a lock stake instead of a vesting stake. withdrawFromPoolingRound(uint64 withdrawValue) — allows to remove Participant's stake from the current pooling round. Parameters: withdrawValue — desired amount of stake to be removed. Function checks that: inbound msg.sender address is address of an existing participant. If real ordinary stake is less than withdrawValue, then DePool returns the whole stake from pooling round. If the remaining stake in the pooling round is less than m_minStake, then the whole stake is transferred to Participant. If the remaining total stake of Participant is 0, then it is removed from the m_stakeholders dictionary. withdrawPart(uint64 withdrawValue) — Allows a participant to withdraw some value from DePool. This function withdraws withdrawValue nanotons when rounds are completed. If participant stake becomes less than minStake, then the whole stake is sent to participant. Parameters: withdrawValue — desired amount of stake to be removed. Function checks that: pool is not closed (m_poolClosed ≠ true);inbound msg.sender address is address of an existing participant. If the remaining stake in the round is less than m_minStake, then the whole stake will be transferred to Participant (after completing round). If the remaining total stake of Participant is 0, then it is removed from the m_stakeholders dictionary. 6. withdrawAll() — Set global flag for the participant that indicates to return participant's ordinary stake after completing rounds. Function checks that: pool is not closed (m_poolClosed ≠ true);inbound msg.sender address is address of an existing participant. After transferring all Participant's stake, the Participant will be removed from the m_stakeholders dictionary. cancelWithdrawal() — Cancel effect of calls of functions withdrawAll and withdrawPart. transferStake(address dest, uint64 amount) — allows to move amount of stake from msg.sender Participant to dest Participant inside DePool storage. Parameters: dest — stake beneficiary;amount — stake value transferred to dest in nanotons. Function checks that: pool is not closed (m_poolClosed ≠ true);destination is a non-zero addr_std;msg.sender ≠ dest;neither destination nor msg.sender is the validator wallet;inbound msg.sender address is address of an existing participant;desired amount can be transferred and transfer doesn't leave stake less than m_minStake in any round.

Why we call it Free Software? What is a relationship between Everscale and Free Software? What is the difference between Free Software and Open Source? I have decided to combine this with an idea I have regarding gas payment redistribution in TON. You will see below why it is related. The concept of Free Software predates open source. Richard Stallman has started the free-software movement in 1983 with a launch of GNU Project while open-source movement has been derived from Free Software only in 1998. To clarify, the Free Software is not in conflict with Open Source. As explained below it follows all the same principles and the differences seems more ideological. Yet TON project did not have any problem with open-source nature of it software. It is all open sourced. The problem was exactly about the Freedom of people to use it. That is why Everscale is heavily influenced by Free Software movement. Declaration of Decentralisation is, in many ways, inspired by Stallman’s «The GNU Manifesto»1. In «Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software» Stallman writes among other things: «The terms «free software» and «open source» stand for almost the same range of programs. However, they say different things about those programs, based on different values. The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. This is why we do not agree with open source, and do not use that term»2. It seems Everscale is in agreement with this line of thought. While all our software is open source it is the Freedom to run the software what has launched this network. Now let’s talk about Copyright and Licensing as they relate to the Free Software in general and Blockchain in particular. Before we start I need to say that blockchain may potentially provide a solution to some of the free software inherited business model problems. We all remember that free in the free software stands for freedom and not for zero price. The ability to get paid for a software should not be based on restrictions imposed by its license. But what it should be based upon then? There are several business models for free software non of which really works. What works is a business model that is not exactly related to the software itself and therefore can not be attributed to it. Such as charging for support or for portions of the software which are closed source. It all seems quite unnatural. It also prevents one of the major points of free software — an open collaboration of the community around software projects. Donald Fischer article title «Open source creators: Red Hat got $34 billion and you got $0. Here’s why»3 is self explanatory. IBM has bought a commercial company that was built on top of many developers’ contribution to its code. Those developers never got any part out of the value they have created. "},{"title":"Aligning the incentives​","type":1,"pageTitle":"COPYLEFT (TIP-1.1)","url":"/standard/TIP-1/1#aligning-the-incentives","content":"Many free and open source software projects struggle to introduce a sustainable business model. This is one of the reasons why most of the open source software contributors work for large corporations. When a venture capital provides funding to a software project it expects multiple return on its capital. With commercial software it is quite straight forward — a company is charging money for its software use and if successful passes profits to its stakeholders. With free software its quite difficult. That is why there are very few (or should we say: not enough) commercially successful open source software companies. Blockchain introduces a unique opportunity for Free Software developers to align their commercial interests with those of users for the benefit of the whole ecosystem. As an Internet of Value protocol, Blockchain has built-in network incentive mechanism — network fees (or gas). To remind: Miners in Proof-Of-Work collect miner rewards and network fees to compensate them for resources spent to secure the network and process transactions. Both security computations and transaction processing are separate resources, thus requiring separate fees. In Proof-Of-Stake Validators commit funds and processing power to secure the network and process transactions (in a form of smart contract execution in TON). For this they also get separate rewards: block rewards in a form of token emission and transaction reward in a form of a fee. Please note, rewards are separated in both cases. We propose to extend the reward model to transaction facilitators. It would be logical to pay part of the fees to the smart contract developer who is initiating the transaction which pays the fee. This will attract both Developers and Users which will increase network usage and total transaction fees for all network participants.

The problem with this approach lays in the fact that network fees not only pays for resources but also provide an important anti spam mechanism. One can use the developer kick-back to simply lower an attack costs. To mitigate that risk we propose a use of a special Payout Contract. This contract is going to pay the collected Copyleft fees to developers only after certain threshold in both amount of fees and time frame are surpassed. In this respect the Developer motivation is again aligned with the Network security model — it is not practical to break the network where one receives a long term rent.

The percentage of gas fees depends on the license type such as that the most free software compatible license provides more gas.

If copyright is a bargain made on behalf of the public, it should serve the public interest above all. The government’s duty when selling the public’s freedom is to sell only what it must, and sell it as dearly as possible. At the very least, we should pare back the extent of copyright as much as possible while maintaining a comparable level of publication»5. One important dimension of copyright is its durationAnother dimension of copyright policy is the extent of fair use: some ways of reproducing all or part of a published work that are legally permitted even though it is copyrighted. (c) Richard Stallman Both duration and fair use of copyright is balanced in this proposal by virtue of compensating copyright holder by Payout Contract creating an ongoing reward from the network while at the same time not preventing a forking possibility by other developers who then need to improve the software in a way that will bring new users and create new intensive for the new contributor. So both improvements as well as long term rent (subscription) is provided for developers. The Copyleft spirit is fully supported here as the Fee is collected for developers who facilitates the fees creation in the first place. The freedom to fork is fully executed as well as anyone can fork the code of a smart contract. In the end it is the community of users who chooses which contract to use and the decision is usually based upon the reputation of the code represented by the hash of the code where is no single byte has been changed. Therefore the system is merit-based. Both long term developer’s incentives for original developers and forking is provided. To recap the proposed system is compatible with all four essential freedoms: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).

They greatly contribute to network security by the means of allocating their stakes to validators. To add, they also direct the Elector's algorithm to validators that should proceed with validation in the next round. This enables well-regarded validators with low stakes to accumulate funds in their pools and subsequently become validators.  Due to the fact that Everscale is a proof of stake blockchain, any participant with enough EVER tokens can become a validator. That’s even if they haven't been nominated by other participants. Validators part the rewards with delegators in accordance with their share of EVER tokens. Although, it should be mentioned that they also share the risks. Thus, if a particular validator node is offline during validation, it is punished by having its stake slashed. Consequently, the delegator's stake may as well be reduced.
