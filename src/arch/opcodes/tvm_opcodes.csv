`0 <= s <= 2`  -  Indicates whether either the multiplication or the division have been replaced by shifts: `s=0` - no replacement, `s=1` - division replaced by a right shift, `s=2` - multiplication replaced by a left shift (possible only for `m=1`).
`0 <= c <= 1`  -  Indicates whether there is a constant one-byte argument `tt` for the shift operator (if `s!=0`). For `s=0`, `c=0`. If `c=1`, then `0 <= tt <= 255`, and the shift is performed by `tt+1` bits. If `s!=0` and `c=0`, then the shift amount is provided to the instruction as a top-of-stack _Integer_ in range `0...256`.
