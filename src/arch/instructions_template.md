## 1 Introduction
This document provides a list of TVM instrucions, their opcodes and mnemonics.

[Here](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/tvm.pdf) is a description of TVM.

Fift is a stack-based programming language designed to manage TON smart contracts. The Fift assembler is a Fift library that converts mnemonics of TVM instructions to their binary representation.

A description of Fift, including the introduction to the Fift assembler, can be found [here](https://github.com/Piterden/TON-docs/blob/master/Fift.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction.md).

This document specifies the corresponding mnemonic for each instruction. Note the following:

1. Fift is a stack-based language, therefore all arguments of an instruction are written before it (e.g. `5 PUSHINT`, `s0 s4 XCHG`).
2. Stack registers are denoted by `s0, s1, ..., s15`. Other stack registers (up to 255) are denoted by `i s()` (e.g. `100 s()`).
3. Control registers are denoted by `c0, c1, ..., c15`.

### 1.1 Gas prices
The gas price of each instruction is specified in this document. The basic gas price of an instruction is `10 + b`, where `b` is the instruction length in bits. Some operations have additional fees:
1. _Parsing cells_: Transforming a cell into a slice costs **100 gas units** if the cell is loading for the first time and **25** for subsequent loads during the same transaction. For such instructions, two gas prices are specified (e.g. `CTOS`: `118/43`).
2. _Cell creation_: **500 gas units**.
3. _Throwing exceptions_: **50 gas units**. In this document the exception fee is only specified for an instruction if its primary purpose is to throw (e.g. `THROWIF`, `FITS`). If the instruction only throws in some cases, two gas prices are specified (e.g. `FITS`: `26/76`).
4. _Tuple creation_: **1 gas unit** for every tuple element.
5. _Implicit jumps_: **10 gas units** for an implicit jump, **5 gas units** for an implicit back jump. This fee is not a part of any instruction.
6. _Moving stack elements between continuations_: **1 gas unit** per element, however first 32 elements moving is free.

### 1.2 CSV table
Machine-readable list of TVM instructions is available [here](./opcodes/tvm_opcodes.csv).

## 2 Stack manipulation primitives

### 5.1 Addition, subtraction, multiplication
{{Table: arithm_basic}}
### 5.2 Division
{{Table: arithm_div}}
### 5.3 Shifts, logical operations
{{Table: arithm_logical}}
### 5.4 Quiet arithmetic primitives
Quiet operations return `NaN` instead of throwing exceptions if one of their arguments is a `NaN`, or in case of integer overflow.
Quiet operations has a prefix `Q` as shown below. Another way to make an operation quiet is to add `QUIET` before it (i.e. one can write `QUIET ADD` instead of `QADD`).
Quiet versions of integer comparison primitives are also available (`QUIET SGN`, `QUIET LESS` etc).

{{Table: arithm_quiet}}

## 6 Comparison primitives
### 6.1 Integer comparison
{{Table: compare_int}}
### 6.2 Other comparison
Most of these "other comparison" primitives actually compare the data portions of _Slices_ as bitstrings (ignoring references if not stated otherwise).

{{Table: compare_other}}

## 7 Cell primitives
### 7.1 Cell serialization primitives
{{Table: cell_build}}
### 7.2 Cell deserialization primitives
{{Table: cell_parse}}

## 8 Continuation and control flow primitives
### 8.1 Unconditional control flow primitives
{{Table: cont_basic}}
### 8.2 Conditional control flow primitives
{{Table: cont_conditional}}
### 8.3 Control flow primitives: loops
{{Table: cont_loops}}
### 8.4 Manipulating the stack of continuations
Here `s"` is the [fee for moving stack elements between continuations](#11-gas-prices). It is equal to the size of the resulting stack minus 32 (or 0 if the stack is smaller than 32).

{{Table: cont_stack}}
### 8.5 Creating simple continuations and closures
{{Table: cont_create}}
### 8.6 Operations with continuation savelists and control registers
{{Table: cont_registers}}
### 8.7 Dictionary subroutine calls and jumps
{{Table: cont_dict}}

## 9 Exception generating and handling primitives
{{Table: exceptions}}

## 10 Dictionary manipulation primitives
Gas consumption of most of the dictionary operations is not fixed, it depends on the contents of the given dictionary.
### 10.1 Dictionary creation
{{Table: dict_create}}
### 10.2 Dictionary serialization and deserialization
{{Table: dict_serial}}
### 10.3 Get dictionary operations
{{Table: dict_get}}
### 10.4 Set/Replace/Add dictionary operations
{{Table: dict_set}}
### 10.5 Builder-accepting variants of Set dictionary operations
The following primitives accept the new value as a _Builder_ `b` instead of a _Slice_ `x`.

{{Table: dict_set_builder}}
### 10.6 Delete dictionary operations
{{Table: dict_delete}}
### 10.7 "Maybe reference" dictionary operations
The following operations assume that a dictionary is used to store values `c?` of type _Maybe Cell_.  The representation is as follows: if `c?` is a _Cell_ , it is stored as a value with no data bits and exactly one reference to this _Cell_.  If `c?` is _Null_, then the corresponding key must be absent from the dictionary.

{{Table: dict_mayberef}}
### 10.8 Prefix code dictionary operations
These are some basic operations for constructing prefix code dictionaries.
These primitives are completely similar to their non-prefix code counterparts (`DICTSET` etc), with the obvious difference that even a _Set_ may fail in a prefix code dictionary, so a success flag must be returned by `PFXDICTSET` as well.

## 12 Debug primitives
Opcodes beginning with `FE` are reserved for the debug primitives. These primitives have known fixed operation length, and behave as (multibyte) `NOP` operations.

However, when invoked in a TVM instance with debug mode enabled, these primitives can produce specific output into the text debug log of the TVM instance, never affecting the TVM state.

`DEBUG` and `DEBUGSTR` are the two debug primitives, they cover all opcodes that start with `FE`.
Other primitives listed here have opcodes from the same set. When debug is enabled, they have their specified effects. When debug is disabled, they behave as `NOP`.
