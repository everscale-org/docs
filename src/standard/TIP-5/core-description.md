# URI scheme

## Abstract

This TIP proposes a URI scheme for making payments and transfers in EVER, fungible and non-fungible tokens.

## Motivation

Payment URIs has become widely adopted since the introduction of Bitcoinâ€™s improvement proposals [BIP-20](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0020.mediawiki), [21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki), [70](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki), [71](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0071.mediawiki), and [72](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0072.mediawiki). For instance, most modern mobile wallets support the scanning of QR codes containing encoded bitcoin payment links.

The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to easily make payments and transfers in EVER, fungible and non-fungible tokens by simply clicking links on web pages or scanning QR Codes.
