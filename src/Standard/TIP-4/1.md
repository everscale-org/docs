# Non-Fungible Token (TIP-4.1)

Requires: [TIP-6.1](./../TIP-6/1.md)

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. General information about NFT collection is stored in the NFT collection contract. Each NFT deployed in separate smart contracts and links to NFT collection contract.

This standard provides basic functionality to create, track and transfer NFTs.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows any nft on Everscale to be re-used by other applications: wallets, explorers, marketplaces and etc

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### NFT collection

#### Supply info

Return the nft supply info.

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view responsible returns (uint128 count);
```

#### Nft code

Return the nft code

```solidity
function nftCode() public view responsible returns (TvmCell code);
```

#### Nft code hash

Return the nft code hash

```solidity
function nftCodeHash() public view responsible returns (uint256 codeHash);
```

#### Nft address

Return nft address by id

```solidity
function nftAddress(uint256 id) public view responsible returns (address nft);
```

#### Collection info

Optional, describe in: [TIP-4.2](./../TIP-4/2.md)

#### Mint nft

A function signature is not included in the specification. 

Collection must mint all nft as smart contract.

Emit event when nft minted

```solidity
event nftCreated(uint256 id, address nft, address owner, address manager, address creator);
```

#### Burn nft

A function signature is not included in the specification. 

Emit event when nft burned

```solidity
event nftBurned(uint256 id, address nft, address owner, address manager);
```

#### Standard interface detection

```solidity
interface TIP41NftCollection {
    function totalSupply() public view responsible returns (uint128 count);
    function nftCode() public view responsible returns (TvmCell code);
    function nftCodeHash() public view responsible returns (uint256 codeHash);
    function nftAddress(uint256 id) public view responsible returns (address nft);
}
```

The nft collection interface ID is `0x00000000`.

### NFT

#### Create Nft

Emit event when nft created

```solidity
event TokenMinted(address owner, address manager);
```

#### Nft info

Return the nft info

```solidity
function getInfo() public view responsible returns(uint256 id, address owner, address manager, address collection);
```

#### Nft content data

Optional, describe in: [TIP-4.2](./../TIP-4/2.md)

#### Transfer Nft

Change nft owner

```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner, address sendGasTo, mapping(address => CallbackParams) callbacks) external;

struct CallbackParams {
    uint256 value;      // ever value will send to address
    TvmCell payload;    // custom payload will proxying to address
}

interface INftChangeOwner {
    function onNftChangeOwner(uint256 id, address oldOwner, address oldManager, address newOwner,  address newManager, address collection, address sendGasTo, TvmCell payload) external;
}
```

Emit event when owner changed

```solidity
event OwnerChanged(address oldOwner, address newOwner);
```

#### Set manager

Change nft manager 

```solidity
function changeManager(address newManager, address sendGasTo, mapping(address => CallbackParams) callbacks) external;

struct CallbackParams {
    uint256 value;      // ever value will send to address
    TvmCell payload;
}

interface INftChangeManager {
    function onNftChangeManager(uint256 id, address oldOwner, address oldManager, address newOwner,  address newManager, address collection, address sendGasTo, TvmCell payload) external;
}
```

Emit event when manager changed

```solidity
event ManagerChanged(address oldManager, address newManager);
```

#### Burn Token

Function signature is not included in the specification

Emit event when nft burned

```solidity
event TokenBurned(address owner, address manager);
```

#### Standard interface detection

```solidity
interface TIP41Nft {
    function getInfo() public view responsible returns(uint256 id, address owner, address manager, address collection);
    function changeOwner(address newOwner, address sendGasTo, mapping(address => CallbackParams) callbacks) external;
    function changeManager(address newManager, address sendGasTo, mapping(address => CallbackParams) callbacks) external;
}


```

The nft interface ID is `0x00000000`.
