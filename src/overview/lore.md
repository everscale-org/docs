# The Lore

**Everscale’s chronicle**

- TON portal for developers with official project specifications is opened - [https://test.ton.org/](https://test.ton.org/).
- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) demands a ban on the issuance of Gram. The SEC, in its report, recognizes Gram as a security (not a commodity or utility token) and that Gram's issue itself violates securities laws.EverX launches its own TON testnet.

**2020**

- The SEC interrogates Pavel Durov about TON ICO. The interrogation took place in Dubai, UAE. The American regulator is trying to find out why Durov launched the ICO, how much money he spent on Telegram and TON, and why the Gram token is not a security. Durov replied that the money was needed to buy equipment and maintain the blockchain platform and that Gram was a utility token, not a security. Telegram challenges the U.S. court ban on transferring Gram tokens to investors. The court of the Southern District of New York State in a preliminary decision agrees with the SEC's opinion that the project's cryptocurrency is a security. The U.S. authorities claim that investors purchased coins to sell on the secondary market to earn money.
- Pavel Durov announced on his Telegram channel that he is closing the TON blockchain project. According to Pavel Durov, Telegram's participation in TON development is over. He urged users not to trust money or data to projects that use the name of the messenger or the platform.EverX participates in the community launch of the Free TON blockchain as the core developer.
