# Getting started

Since Everscale was created on the principles of decentralization, the management and development of the network is completely decentralized thanks to its community.

This section provides ways to improve the network by bringing something new to Everscale.

### Everscale Grants

Everscale Grants is a campaign that aims to attract promising IT projects that can contribute to the Everscale ecosystem's growth.

Approved projects receive not only financial, but also technical and marketing support.

The formation and distribution of grants is handled by DeFi Alliance.

DeFi Alliance is a business combination that creates the necessary infrastructure to attract teams and projects, raises liquidity from other projects in Everscale, and builds partnerships with large companies with large amounts of liquidity.

To apply, use the [form](https://everscale.network/developers/grants/application) on the [Everscale Grants page](https://everscale.network/developers/grants) on the [network's website](https://everscale.network/) or Everscale DeFi Alliance[corresponding page](https://everalliance.org/apply-for-grant/) of their [official website](https://everalliance.org/).

### Contests

Contests are a way to develop and support Everscale, as well as a way that the network’s meritocratic coin distribution model is put into practice.

Contests are held in various areas, such as programming, design, SMM, PR, and so on. Some of them are aimed at technically improving operation, while others are to increase awareness of the blockchain and attract new users.

Everscale's management is divided into subgovernances – groups of people, each of which is responsible for a certain type of activity and contests within Everscale. Members of the subgovernances receive a portion of tokens for community development, contests, etc.

Prizes for first place sometimes reach 500,000 EVER and average between 10,000 and 100,000 EVER.

Check out active and completed contests at [EverKit Governance](https://gov.everkit.org/).

### EVER DAO

[EVER DAO](https://everdao.net) is a decentralized governance platform that allows EVER (wEVER) token holders to vote on proposals relating to the Everscale network. Community members can express their will and opinion on significant network events in a transparent and verifiable way.

To participate in voting, you must have a certain stake EVER, which will be equivalent to the strength of your vote.

### EverStart 

[EverStart](https://everstart.io/) - is a DAO-managed multi-chain launcher for connecting to curated projects.

This is the first Everscale blockchain launchpad, thanks to which the community has the opportunity not only to decide which project is worthy of being in the network ecosystem, but also to benefit from its further development through vesting.

### Octus Bridge DAO

[Octus Bridge](https://octusbridge.io/bridge) is a cross-chain solution that allows you to move liquidity between Everscale and many other chains.

Octus Bridge also has its native BRIDGE token.

BRIDGE token holders can vote on certain operational decisions of the Octus Bridge platform to make the bridge better. The voting protocol is a real smart contract that is allowed to make changes to other smart contracts.

There are now more than 23 relays of particular importance in the [Bridge DAO](https://app.octusbridge.io/governance) structure. Any user with at least 100,000 BRIDGE tokens can become a relay.
