# DePools

DPs are smart contracts that allow other smart contracts to invest stakes in a common pool of funds and, after some period of time, to receive it back with interest.

Please follow [**this link**](https://docs.everscale.network/validate/depools/getting-started/) for the documentation containing instructions on how to deploy and configure a DePool smart contract, and run a validator node through it.
