# Update Validator

**Note:** You may need to renew your copy of main.ton.dev scripts but do not remove any working files from the previous deployment (for example, configs folder).

Adjust (specify new commit ID) main.ton.dev/scripts/env.sh:

    export TON_NODE_GITHUB_REPO="https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-node.git"
    export TON_NODE_GITHUB_COMMIT_ID="master"
    export TON_NODE_TOOLS_GITHUB_REPO="https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-node-tools.git"
    export TON_NODE_TOOLS_GITHUB_COMMIT_ID="master"
    export TONOS_CLI_GITHUB_REPO="https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli.git"
    export TONOS_CLI_GITHUB_COMMIT_ID="master"

Upgrade the node:

    ./upgrade.sh 2>&1 | tee ./upgrade.log

**Note:** the log generated by this command will be located in the main.ton.dev/scripts/ folder and can be useful for troubleshooting.

Wait until the node is synced.
