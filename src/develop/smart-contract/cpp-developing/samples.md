# C++ Contract Samples

[A repository with examples of contracts, as well as information on their compilation, deployment, and more](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/README.md)

A list of examples of C++ contracts is given below:

### 1. [Hello, world!](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/HelloWorld): Introduces general concepts of the contract development.    


This example is a part of [C++ Tutorial](getting-started.md) which is a step by step guidance on how to create your first contract.

### 2. [Authorization](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/Authorization): Demonstrate a message signature check.

This example is a part of [C++ Tutorial](getting-started.md). The example extends [Hello, world!](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/HelloWorld) example by introducing signature cheching to prevent spam attack on a contract and make it run out of money.

### 3. [Giver](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/Giver):  The contract sends the requested amount of money.

This example is a part of [C++ Tutorial](getting-started.md). It shows how to call a public method with parameters from another contract.

### 4. [Wallet](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/Wallet): Simple contract to hold and spend EVER.

### 5. [PiggyBank](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/Piggybank): Contract for savings.

The example consist of three contracts which exchange messages between each other. It shows simplest form of an internal call of a public method. It also show how a mechanism of internal authorization might work.

### 6. [Kamikaze](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/cpp/Kamikaze): The example shows how a contract could be deleted from the network.
