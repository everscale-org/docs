# DInterfaces

## DeBot-IS-consortium

DeBot Interface Specifications (IS) Consortium. IS a place where community defines interfaces every DeBot browser should support.

- [DeBot-IS-consortium repository](https://github.com/tonlabs/DeBot-IS-consortium)

### Application Rules:

Each new interface must create a folder, which has a readme.md desciption of an interface, example of its implementaion in both Solidity and C++ placed in an "examples" sub folder.

### Interface submission proccess:

- You should create a specifications proposal, discuss it.
- After the discussion is over and proposal is accepted you should submit examples in both Solidity and C++.
- Only proposals with examples will be published.

### Supported browsers:

- If you implemented a DeBot browser we will be happy to list it. Please let us know.
- Your browser should clearly state interfaces which it supports (by version number as stated in repository).
