# Getting started

## Overview

Welcome to the most exciting and innovative platform to build your blockchain application on Everscale Blockchain. Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the way the digital world handles data and does business. Be a part of this revolution and get a head start with decentralized application development on Everscale.

This page will tell you how to best choose the development approaches and tools for yourself.

> **Attention!** Before you read this article, we recommend that you study the [Everscale Overview section](../../learn/everscale-overview/) and the block of pages in the [Architecture section](../../arch/) if you want to develop complex products on the Everscale blockchain.

## Let's start 

Before you start developing or integrating anything into Everscale, we would like to tell you about the tools and environment that you will use in your work.

First of all, it is worth noting that Everscale is really a decentralized blockchain, not only from a technical point of view, but also from a management side, so the key tools and approaches to development may differ from different teams, technical contributors on the network.

At the moment, there are two active companies of technical contributors in Everscale network:

- [Broxus](https://broxus.com)
- [EverX](https://everx.dev/)

And it is their solutions and tools that you will use when developing, while you will have every opportunity to write your own solutions as well, if necessary or desired.  
You can learn more in the [Development tools section](../api-tools/overview.md).

### Here are ways to dive into development on Everscale for any case you need

We assume that there are several main cases of developers interacting with Everscale:

- Build your dApp - knowledge of network architecture, understanding of smart contracts, standards and node devices will be useful to you.
  - Learn the [network architecture](../../arch/)
  - Learn the [standards](../../standard/)
  - Learn the [development tools](../api-tools/overview.md)
  - Learn the specifics of writing [smart contracts](../smart-contract/learn/)

- Learn how to [issue tokens](../smart-digital-assets/issue-ft.md)
- Explore the development team [incentive programs in Everscale](../hackathons-grants.md)

- Migrate your dApp from another network
  - Learn the [network architecture](../../arch/)
  - Learn the [comparison with Ethereum](../from-another-platform/comparison-with-ethereum.md)
  - Learn the [development tools](../api-tools/overview.md)
  - Learn how to [write contracts on Solidity](../smart-contract/solidity-developing/getting-started.md)

- Integrate Everscale blockchain in your on-chain or off-chain project - you will find it helpful to explore the Everscale Overview section as well as the Architecture page, after which it is that you take a look at Getting Started in the Integrate section.
  - Learn [Everscale Overview section](../../learn/everscale-overview/)
  - Learn [how to integrate](../integrate/tutorial/getting-started.md) anyting with Everscale.
  - Learn the [development tools](../api-tools/overview.md)
  - Learn popular integration cases [(exchange integration)](../integrate/tutorial/add-everscale-to-your-exchange.md)
