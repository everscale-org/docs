# TON Indexer

Via following [**this link**](https://github.com/broxus/ton-indexer) you will get familiar with a simple and reliable indexer node. It is a simplified, refactored and optimized version of ton-labs-node and would not have been implemented without their gigantic work of reverse engineering the original ะก++ node.
