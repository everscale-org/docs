# EVER Scan API

At the moment, there is no ready-made documentation for the EVER Scan API, but you can study it yourself using the link below:

- [**explorer-api.broxus.com/v1**](https://explorer-api.broxus.com/v1) -
This API allows you to get the Everscan info, such as account, blocks, transactions and other data.
