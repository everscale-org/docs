The DAO-controlled [**Octus Bridge**](https://octusbridge.io/) facilitates cross-chain transfers between Everscale and multiple Ethereum-based networks.

- [**api.octusbridge.io/v1**](https://api.octusbridge.io/v1/swagger.yaml) - This API allows you to get the Octus Bridge data about relayers, staking, transfers and other information.
