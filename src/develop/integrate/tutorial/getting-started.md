# Getting started

If you are not yet familiar with the Everscale network, we recommend that you read the [Everscale overview section](../../../learn/overview.md), where you can learn about the main features and benefits of the network.

## Tools

Also, you will need to learn the basic [development tools](../../tools/) for integration.
Among them, you will find options to connect to the blockchain, create a deposit account, etc.

[TONOS-CLI](../../tools/tonos-cli.md) - command line tool for the TON blockchain that allows you to deploy any smart contracts on the blockchain, call all contract methods, sign transactions, and generally manage your account.

[EVER Cloud](../../nodes-clients/evercloud.md) - EVER Cloud allows you to work with the Everscale blockchain and development network without having to launch your own node. 

[Ever SDK](https://github.com/tonlabs/ever-sdk)

[Wallet API](../../nodes-clients/ton-wallet-api.md) - HTTP Api solution for a wallet running on the Everscale network

## APIs

We highly recommend reading the APIs of the most popular products at Everscale:

[FlatQube](https://docs.flatqube.io/integrate/open-api) - Everscale's main DEX. Check out the official documentation pages for DEX Indexer and Farming Indexer.
