# Introduction 

The rapid advancement of blockchain technology and subsequent development of different blockchain networks has led to a heightened demand for cross-chain solutions. 

Everscale puts at the user's disposal Octus Bridge, which facilitates cross - chain transactions in any direction within a single interface. Currently, Octus Bridge offers cross-chain transactions between Everscale, Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, BNB chain, Avalanche, Milkomeda and the number of networks is constantly increasing.


## What are bridges?

A blockchain bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of tokens between completely different networks, such as Everscale and Ethereum, as well as between one parent blockchain and its child chain, called a side chain. In the same way as a physical bridge connects two physical locations, a blockchain bridge connects two blockchain networks. Bridges provide the means for communication between blockchain networks via the transfer of information and assets.



## Why do we need bridges?

All blockchains have their limitations. For Everscale to achieve a high throughput and keep up with increased demand, it implemented sharding. Namely, computational resources sharding. On the other hand, blockchains like Solana and Ethereum are made up differently in order to enable higher throughput but at the cost of reduced decentralization.
