# Intro

In this series of examples we will figure out basic steps you need to follow to build a UI around any smart contract and perform various routines common for both frontend and backend parts of any application. We expect a reader to have basic experience with JS.

For React developers, there is an [example](https://github.com/mnill/everscale-crash-course-token-dice-frontend) of a React App built around Everscale smart-contracts.

Before we start, please make sure you've read through basic theory that we put under the [Build](/develop) section of this documentation, especially the [Smart Contracts, ABI and Messages](/develop/sc-abi-messages.md) article.

Also, be aware that we borrow some code samples from the full [Everscale Development Guide](https://everscale.guide/), so donâ€™t hesitate to check that out if you want to dive deeper into the context.
