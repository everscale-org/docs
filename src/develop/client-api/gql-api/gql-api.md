# About GraphQL API

GraphQL API is shared by all [Evernode Platform](https://docs.everos.dev/evernode-platform) products, developed by
core Everscale developer EverX. 

Due to the GraphQL ability to stitch its schemas, GraphQL API is in fact a set of "stitched" APIs behind it. Meanwhile all Evernode Platform products share the same core API that allows to communicate with Everscale network, [each product has its own subset](https://docs.everos.dev/evernode-platform/products/functionality-comparison) of APIs corresponding to the Product use-cases.
