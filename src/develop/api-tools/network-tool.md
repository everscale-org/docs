# Network Tool

Via following [**this link**](https://github.com/tonlabs/everdev/blob/main/docs/command-line-interface/network-tool.md) you will get familiar with the Network tool which is a convenient way to organize all of your network configurations in one place. You can register several networks under short names and then use these names as a target blockchain when working with contracts.
