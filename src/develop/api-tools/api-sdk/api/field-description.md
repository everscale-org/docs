## Account type

Recall that a smart contract and an account are the same thing in the context of the Everscale Blockchain, and that these terms can be used interchangeably, at least as long as only small (or “usual”) smart contracts are considered. A large smart-contract may employ several accounts lying in different shardchains of the same workchain for load balancing purposes.

An account is identified by its full address and is completely described by its state. In other words, there is nothing else in an account apart from its address and state.

Can be queried by following fields:

## Transaction Type

The table below shows how our GraphQL scheme matches fields of Everscale transaction TLB schemes. In most cases, the specification is quoted to describe the fields. Meaning of fields is also sometime self-explanatory.

For more details, check the specification at [https://test.ton.org/tblkch.pdf](https://test.ton.org/tblkch.pdf).

The gas payment, equal to the product of the gas price and the gas consumed, is exacted from the account balance. If there is no reason to skip the computing phase, TVM is invoked and the results of the computation are logged. Possible parameters are covered below. |

Almost all value of the original inbound message (minus gas payments and forwarding fees) is transferred to the generated message, which otherwise has an empty body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Message type

Message layout queries. A message consists of its header followed by its body or payload. The body is essentially arbitrary, to be interpreted by the destination smart contract. It can be queried with the following fields.

## MsgEnvelope type

Message envelopes are used for attaching routing information, such as the current (transit) address and the next-hop address, to inbound, transit, and outbound messages.

## InMsg type

A type to specify the parameter of the inbound message. You can query the source of the message, the reason for it's being imported into this block, and some information about its “fate” — its processing by a transaction or forwarding inside the block.

## BlockMasterShardHashesDescr type

ShardHashes is represented by a dictionary with 32-bit workchain_ids as keys, and “shard binary trees”, represented by TL-B type BinTree ShardDescr, as values. Each leaf of this shard binary tree contains a value of type ShardDescr, which describes a single shard by indicating the sequence number seq_no, the logical time lt, and the hash hash of the latest (signed) block of the corresponding shardchain.

| before_split          | bool   | Everscale Blockchain supports dynamic sharding, so the shard configuration may change from block to block because of shard merge and split events. Therefore, we cannot simply say that each shardchain corresponds to a fixed set of accountchains. A shardchain block and its state may each be classified into two distinct parts. The parts with the ISP-dictated form of will be called the split parts of the block and its state, while the remainder will be called the non-split parts. The masterchain cannot be split or merged. |

## BlockMasterConfig Type

BlockMasterConfig type field is present only in key blocks. The previous key block seq_no is always present in all masterchain blocks in prev_key_block_seqno field.

This structure contains all Everscale blockchain configurations parameters.
