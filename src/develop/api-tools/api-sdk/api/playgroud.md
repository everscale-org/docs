# Web Playground

> Referenced repository: [https://docs.everos.dev/ever-sdk/reference/ever-os-api/web_playground](https://docs.everos.dev/ever-sdk/reference/ever-os-api/web_playground)

**Test your queries and explore blockchain data**

GraphQL web playground is available for each network at its root endpoint URL.  
See the [previous section](networks.md) for more details.

E.g., if you are working with TON Labs Developer network, check the playground at [https://rbx01.net.everos.dev/graphql](https://rbx01.net.everos.dev/graphql).  
The general address convention is `network/graphql`.

Use the playground to enter queries in the left side and get response in the right side. We have video tutorials showing how to use the playground.

Also check other documents in this section.
