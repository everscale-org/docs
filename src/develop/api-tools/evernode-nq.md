# Evernode NQ

Via following [**this link**](https://github.com/tonlabs/Evernode-NQ) you will get familiar with the repository that contains documents describing the architecture of a solution for delivering encrypted messages from the blockchain to end-users. The solution ensures that neither the sender nor the intermediary can decrypt messages or match smart contracts (e.g. wallets) with recipients.

> The documentation in Everscale repository is a community effort. Therefore, everyone can contribute with proposals for new topics, suggest new content elements, participate in editing, and provide ideas that will be of great help for network development. Please be informed that our documentation can be edited via GitHub. It can be found [**here**](https://docs.everscale.network/).
