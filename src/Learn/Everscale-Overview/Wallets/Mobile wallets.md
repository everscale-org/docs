### EVER Surf

Ever is a free, private and simple blockchain interface that is a wallet for storing funds, as well as a built-in functional chat.

The application provides access to your account, token balance, transaction history and other activities available on the network. The wallet has not only a browser, but also a mobile version. There is also a version for testers.

The wallet combines both basic functions, such as transferring tokens to wallets of other users, but also more specific ones, such as chat, a list of contracts, a browser for debots, built-in bots, developer mode and staking functionality.

A distinctive feature of the following three wallets is not only multicurrency, but also the ability to buy TON right inside the application using a bank card or other currencies for further storage on the wallet. Of course, they all have their own technical differences, so we suggest that you familiarize yourself with them in more detail on their official websites and choose the one that suits you.
