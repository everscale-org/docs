## About Everscale

Everscale is a unique blockchain design that proposes a scalable decentralized world computer, paired with a distributed operating system â€” **Ever OS**.  
[Ever OS](../concept/arch/00-ever-os.md) is capable of processing millions of transactions per second, with Turing-complete smart contracts and decentralized user interfaces.  

Everscale presents some new and unique properties, such as dynamic multithreading, soft majority consensus and distributed programming, which enable it to be scalable, fast and secure at the same time. It is governed by a decentralized community founded upon meritocratic principles via Soft Majority Voting protocol.

Everscale has powerful developer tools, such as compilers for Solidity and C++, API, an SDK that includes client libraries for 13 programming languages and all popular platforms, local node for DApp testing, CLI tools and a range of decentralized browsers and wallets empowering many applications in DeFi, NFT, tokenization and governance domains.

## Key organizations

There are many companies that were formed around Everscale that boosted the growth of the network.

Let's take a look at some of them:

[Everscale DeFi Alliance](https://everalliance.org/) - Everscale DeFi Alliance creates the necessary infrastructure to interest and maintain strong teams and projects, attract liquidity from other projects to Everscale and establish partnerships with major companies with large amounts of liquidity and/or a large number of transactions.

[Everscale Grants](https://everscale.network/developers/grants) - is a campaign that aims to attract promising IT projects that can contribute to the Everscale ecosystem's growth.

[EVER DAO](https://everdao.net/governance) - is a platform where EVER token holders can make on-chain governance decisions for the whole Everscale Network.

Ever Foundation (the website is under construction).  
It will become the primary entry point for all kinds of projects that want to develop and create their products and businesses on top of the Everscale. The Foundation provides grant support to projects that bring the greatest benefit to the network, and actively promotes them.
