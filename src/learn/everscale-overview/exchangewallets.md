In this section, we will introduce you to the most popular EVER wallets.

## Non-custodial wallets
  
Non-custodial - the user has full control over the keys and their funds. If the private key and the password to recover it are lost, the funds will be irretrievably lost.

## Custodial wallets

Custodial wallets are similar to bank instruments. The user does not have full control over their funds because an operator (custodian) has access to the private key. Pros: having lost passwords or keys, the user has the opportunity to gain access to the funds again.
