# Welcome

Welcome to Everscale!

On this page you will find a brief overview of Everscale - the fastest and scalable network.

## About Everscale

### What is Everscale?

Everscale is a fast, secure and scalable blockchain and network project capable of processing up to a million transactions per second thanks to its unique dynamic technology.

### History

**Ton Development (2017-2019)**

Brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov and the Telegram team develop the TON (The Open Network) project.
The company TON Labs (now EverX) develops TON OS.

**TON closing (2020)**

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prohibits the issue of Gram tokens (TON currency).
Pavel Durov announces the closure of the project.

**Free TON launch (May 7, 2020)**

The community (consisting of TON developers and potential users, including TON Labs) launches the Free TON blockchain platform with its native currency TON Crystal.

**Everscale (2021)**

A decentralized decision was made at the end of 2021 to rebrand Free TON to Everscale, and the ticker name from TON to EVER.

The innovative TON architecture is the foundation of Everscale.
However, Everscale is already much more than just TON.
Our community has two years of hard work behind it. 

### Benefits

**Fast**

Everscale has the fastest speed of any blockchain.
The blockchain architecture makes it possible to process up to a million transactions per second.

**Safe**

With advanced end-to-end encryption, Everscale offers multiple layers of security for sensitive information despite an open, transparent data pool for all transactions.

**Innovative**

Everscale introduces some new and unique features such as dynamic multithreading, soft majority consensus, and distributed programming.

**[Decentralized](decentralization)**

Everscale is run by a decentralized community based on meritocratic principles through a soft majority protocol.

### Features

**[Smart contracts](../develop/smart-contract/)**

A smart contract is a program that is stored and executed on a blockchain. The results of smart contracts are verified and confirmed by many network nodes, which ensures end-to-end decentralization, as well as resistance of calculations to errors and malicious attacks.

On the Everscale network, the implementation of smart contracts is conceived to be universal. As a result, all wallets and the implementation of any additional logic as a whole involve smart contracts, unlike in many other blockchains of previous generations. In addition, all interactions between smart contracts are asynchronous (unlike, for example, in Ethereum), which is necessary to scale network performance.

An important property of the Everscale network is that any network action to process a smart contract burns a small amount of tokens, which protects against abuse and DDoS attacks. It quickly becomes very expensive and unprofitable to create a sufficiently high load for DDoS attack.

**[Staking](../validate/staking.md)**

We can understand staking as receiving passive income through storing cryptocoins. This process uses the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm – proof of share of ownership. PoS is one of the methods to protect the blockchain from interference and inaccuracy of the data placed. Staking is kind of an alternative to traditional mining.

**Cheap transactions**

The wallet-to-wallet transaction fee is currently around 0.012 EVER.

**Farming**

Farming is the process of earning tokens as a reward for providing liquidity to a project by placing a specific pair of tokens in a pool.

**[Grants](../develop/hackathons-grants.md)**

Everscale Grants is a campaign designed to attract promising IT projects that can contribute to the development of the Everscale ecosystem.

**[Validators](../validate/)**

Validators are the nodes in the blockchain system that have the task of keeping the network running. A validator is a set of software. A person or team simply runs, configures, and controls it.

**[TIP-3 Tokens](../standard/TIP-3/1.md)**

TIP-3 Token is an Everscale token standard that describes the basic principles for building token smart contracts. The current version is TIP-3.1

**[DePools](decentralization/depool-specifications.md)**

A DePool (depool) is a smart contract that allows users to combine deposits of different network users to form blocks by validators.

A DePool is required if a node that wants to become a validator does not have enough of its own funds for a stake. With this smart contract, users transfer (invest) their stakes into a common pool, for which they receive a reward depending on the amount deposited after each validation cycle.

**[Bridge](everscale-overview/bridges.md)**

A blockchain bridge is a link that provides communication and interaction between two blockchains. Thanks to such bridges, any data, information, and tokens can be transferred between two blockchain platforms.

**Swap**

A token swap is a process in which one cryptocurrency is exchanged for another at a predetermined rate.

**NFT**

NFTs are a "hot" trend in the cryptocurrency world.
Issuing NFTs through Everscale is beneficial not only because the network has very fast and cheap transactions. The process of issuing and exchanging NFTs has become even easier with the release of True NFT technology, which has made it possible to place all NFT data (including content) in the blockchain, look up records of collections and tokens, and actually transfer tokens from one address to another like ordinary coins.

### [Decentralization](decentralization)

Special attention should be paid to decentralization in Everscale’s management

How can we manage a blockchain project in a decentralized way? In Everscale, anyone can influence the project’s development. We use a public forum to discuss important decisions. We have also formed certain devices in the project that help make important decisions using the soft mechanism Majority Voting. Let's take a look at the tools we've created for governance.

**Main Governance**

The chief task of members of the main governance is to sign transactions for issuing funds from providers (more than 50% of signatures are required).  
Members of the main governance are sometimes called initial members.

**[EVER DAO](https://everdao.net/)** 

EVER DAO is a decentralized governance platform that allows EVER (WEVER) token holders to vote on proposals concerning the Everscale network.   
Community members can express their will and opinion on significant network events in a transparent and verifiable way.

**[Subgovernances](https://gov.everkit.org/en/subgovs)**

Subgovernances are groups of people, each of which is responsible for a certain type of activity. Members of subgovernances receive coins for Everscale’s development (for example, by organizing contests)

**[DeFi Alliance](https://everalliance.org/)**

This is an association of companies that creates the necessary infrastructure to attract teams and projects, raise liquidity from other projects in Everscale, and create partnerships with large companies with large amounts of liquidity.

## Tokens

**EVER** 

Everscale currency ticker.  
A short name that is used in wallets, exchanges, etc.

The currency is used to pay for gas (transaction fees) and fees to validators, as well as reward stakeholders and contest participants. It also performs a number of other important functions within the network.

Everscale also has a technological solution known as TIP3 – the ability to create your own tokens (similar to Ethereum ERC20)
