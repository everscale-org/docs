## About Everscale

Everscale is a unique blockchain design that proposes a scalable decentralized world computer, paired with a distributed operating system â€” **Ever OS**.  
[Ever OS](../arch/06-ever-os.md) is capable of processing millions of transactions per second, with Turing-complete smart contracts and decentralized user interfaces.  

Everscale presents some new and unique properties, such as dynamic multithreading, soft majority consensus and distributed programming, which enable it to be scalable, fast and secure at the same time. It is governed by a decentralized community founded upon meritocratic principles via Soft Majority Voting protocol.  

Everscale has powerful developer tools, such as compilers for Solidity and C++, API, SDK that includes client libraries for 13 programming languages and all popular platforms, local node for DApp testing, CLI tools and a range of decentralized browsers and wallets empowering many applications in DeFi, NFT, tokenization and governance domains.
